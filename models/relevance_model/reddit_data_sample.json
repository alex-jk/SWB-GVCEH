The victim, a male youth, reported that he and a friend were in the playground when two other males unknown to them approached and took their longboards. When the victim approached the two males who had taken their longboards, he was assaulted with a weapon. \n \nThe unprovoked assault left the male youth with non-life-threatening, but potentially life-altering injuries.

The woman was agitated and acting erratically, and accused the officer of stealing the dog she was walking. The woman then physically attacked the off-duty officer. A struggle ensued that went to the ground and the suspect struck the officer several times, including violently kicking the officer several times while she was on the ground. The suspect then fled the area.\n\nThe officer did not require medical treatment at the scene. She was off-duty and recovering from a life-altering injury sustained nearly two years ago after being assaulted by a suspect during a different police incident.\n\nPatrol officers responded to the incident and located the suspect a short distance away from the scene. Officers arrested the suspect without further incident.\n\nThe suspect was transported to VicPD cells where she was later released with a court date and conditions. She will face recommended charges of assault.\n\nIn British Columbia, the decision to release a person is based on the likelihood they will attend court, the risk posed to public safety, and the impact on confidence in the criminal justice system.  In addition, Bill C-75, which came into effect nationally in 2019, has legislated a \u201cprinciple of restraint\u201d that requires police to release an accused person at the earliest possible opportunity after considering these factors. This is founded in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that every person has the right to liberty and the presumption of innocence pre-trial.  Police are also asked to consider the circumstances of Indigenous or vulnerable person in the process, in order to address the disproportionate impacts that the criminal justice system has on these populations.\n\nThis file remains under investigation.\n\nIf you have information about this incident, please call our non-emergency line at (250) 995-7654.

I just want to remind everyone that City Councils are basically all powerful on housing change in Victoria and the surrounding municipalities.

There is no housing growth without these being upzoned and allowing walkups, townhouses, etc. Demand is steadily increasing while supply stays the same. \n\nIf you are upset about the lack of housing being built\/allowed to be built, please email letters to mayor and council in all municipalities that are lacking on housing.
