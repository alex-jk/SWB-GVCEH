Here are my thoughts so far\n\nLocation 8\/10 - The old liquor store in Cook street village behind Prima Strada. Hot spot area but its quite hidden.\n\nParking  5\/10 - Kinda crappy actually, There is a pay lot directly infront of it and no free spots. Street parking in the area is often difficult. Still much better than their downtown location.\n\nStaff 8\/10 - Friendly and helpful\n\nSignage 4\/10 - Honestly it is hard to spot. perhaps they should have a light on their sign indicating dounts r in stock :(\n\nSeating  1\/10 - Not a comfortable place to eat in. Two high top small round table with 4 extra small stools surround. Basically a takeout restaurant. Not family friendly at all.\n\nStore and atmosphere 2\/10 - The look and colors are ok but the place is underlit on a cold rainy day. No music and line moves very slow as people hum and haw over donuts.\n\nFood 9\/10 - Honestly their chicken was good ( better than thunderbird chicken 1 block away) and the waffle fries great. I topped it off with a donut to end which was outstanding.\n\nPrice 1\/10 - For 2 piece chicken and waffle fries plus one dount and rootbeer it cost me $25. Too me that is ridiculous. To top off they hand u the meal in a takeout box regardless of eating in. I can have a great topclass meal for $25 at a sitdown restaurant with a full waiter staff topping up my water every second and handing me free bread with an actual plate to eat on.\n\nHours 3\/10 - They are only open till 3pm which kinda sucks. Another thing that sucks is that they run out of donuts often and sometimes by noon which sucks. Going out of your way to go to a local donut shop but seeing a sold out sign at noon makes me not want to come back especially if I just paid for parking.\n\nOverall 6.5\/10 - It has potential if they adjusted some things, get some dedicated parking,get some booths inside and optimize seating, played some music, offered some more beverage options, offer combo deals and reduce the price.\n\nWill this place survive? I am not sure. With stiff competition in the area like big wheel burger, prima strata and newly opened Thunderbird fried chicken better valued good chicken) just a block away they will have to really be on the ball. They will heavily rely on their donut sales to stay in business.\n\n\n\n","TitleText":"Empire Donuts and Fried Chicken thoughts?.

Sorry for the wall of text. \n\nMy aunt has tried to kill herself. The first time was May 2013. It came as a shock to our family. \n\nShe is in her 50's, but due to lack of oxygen at birth she was developmentally delayed. I don't know how best to describe her. She can function as an adult in some ways, but in others she is like a child. She has tantrums like a toddler at times, and has poor ability to grasp consequences. She has a lot of trouble expressing herself. She has always lived with my grandmother, who is now in her late 80's and is in denial about the situation with her daughter. \n\nA month or so ago, my aunt tried to kill herself again. Both times were by taking pills. We told grandma that all pills have to be kept from my aunt, but my grandma seems to think that my aunt is just behaving like a bratty child. She can't seem to grasp the seriousness and isn't making much of an effort to keep the drugs secured. \n\nThe first overdose was worse than the second. It really messed up her body. She was in hospital for several days, and then was sent home. Since then, she has had tinnitus (or something similar) that is causing her to basically lose her mind. She goes to the emergency room every week or two. She sees her family doctor or clinic doctors on a weekly basis. They keep *fucking* prescribing pills!!! All she wants is for the noises in her head to go away. There is nothing medically wrong with her that can be detected at this point (she has had all sorts of tests, MRIs, etc). \n\nAfter the attempt last month, she told us she wants to go into a care facility. The problem is that she doesn't qualify for one. After the first OD she was clearly in a major state of depression. She wouldn't talk to anyone anymore. After the second attempt, things seemed better. I thought maybe it is because she thought she would get the help she wants\/needs, but now I'm not so sure. I worry that she has made up her mind to die, and that is what is making her feel better. \n\nI just found out that she tried to drink chemicals a few days ago, but my grandma stopped her. \n\nWe are at a loss. She can't talk to counsellors because she doesn't understand that they're not there to help with the tinnitus. She just babbles about her head. We truly believe that she will keep trying to kill herself until she succeeds. We don't know how to keep her safe. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? Can we have her committed? Hospital staff seem completely unwilling to do anything other than prescribe pills and send her home. We are desperate to help her. I've posted enough info here for my friends\/acquaintances to recognize me, but I don't know where else to turn. \n\nThank you. ","TitleText":"Need help with a mental health issue.

This meant we had to find a new place to live. We acted quickly and signed a lease for a new space which is $350 more per month. We began planning our move which included hiring movers, packing up most of our things, hiring a carpet cleaner for the apartment we\u2019re moving out of as per the tenancy agreement, etc. We emailed our intended move out date to the property management company. Today, 1 week out from the move, we get a call from the property management company saying that the owners no longer want to move back in because they got a great deal on another condo and that we can stay.

But after talking to the volunteers and leaders at Our Place, as well as some nurses working for similar organizations, my perspective broadened to the point where I myself can see the lack of publicly available information regarding pressing issues and the general topic of homelessness in Victoria. \n\nSo if you're interested in having an \"Ask me Anything\" with some of the leaders and volunteers at Our Place Society, let me know in the poll and depending on the interest I may be able to convince a few of them to frequently check a formal reddit post on the topic (will also need to check with moderators about how to best organize this event). Thanks, stay safe, stay healthy folks.\n\n[View Poll](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/poll\/k030ge)","relevance_score":0.2727272727,"most_common_centroid_id":[1],"Score_model2":27.27,"label_model2":1,"label_model1":1,"relevant_sentences":"After being an \"outsider\" to the organization and general homelessness in Victoria for a number of years and more recently meeting the awesome people who volunteer and do great work at Our Place Society, my perspective and knowledge on the current societal issues and organizational developments has changed and grown...

We know that concentrating all the social housing and social services in the city in one neighbourhood leads to bad outcomes, it concentrates poverty, makes most people just avoid that area, and leads to exactly what we have in some parts of downtown and Harris Green currently. If you had a drug addiction you were trying to recover from or mental health issues that were seriously affecting your life you probably wouldn't do too well if the only supportive housing you were offered was right on the 900 block of Pandora, we have to give people the opportunity to get out of that environment, and housing facilities like this do exactly that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo please, sit down after work today for five minutes and type out an email to council. You can send your letter to [mayorandcouncil@victoria.ca](mailto:mayorandcouncil@victoria.ca) and it will be forwarded to all councillors and the mayor, as well as being published permanently in the agenda for Thursday's meeting with your email redacted (though nothing else is). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* You should include the address of the site (225 Russell Street) in the subject line of your email\n* Start with saying you want them to support the project\n* Be professional, polite, and say **why** you want them to support the project\n* Sign off with your actual name, and if you want your address or just the neighbourhood you live in\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo please, if you've ever complained on here about homelessness in the city, about the housing crisis, or about \"the state of downtown!\" actually write in to council on this project, because I guarantee it will do more than just talking about the issues here.
