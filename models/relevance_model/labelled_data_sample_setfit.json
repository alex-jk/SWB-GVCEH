{"text":"Packers and movers from Montreal to Victoria BC. Hello there! I hope everyone's having a good afternoon. \n\nI'm currently an International student in Montreal, and I'm moving to Victoria in April 2022 for my job. I have been living in Montreal with my partner for a while, and we already have a lot of furniture (a king-sized bed, a TV, a treadmill are the main components), along with a few cupboards\/wardrobes. \n\nDoes anyone know of any good\/reliable packers and movers who deliver and set up things all the way to Victoria BC, and help out with unpacking, installation? Alternatively, would you suggest selling the furniture and buying new ones once we reach Victoria?\n\n I know Montreal is very far away, so I was worried about the move to the west coast. If anyone has any similar experiences of moving to the west coast from the east coast, I'd love to hear your experiences on getting adjusted with furniture and basic equipments, and setting down. \n\nThank you!","label":1,"Predicted_Label":0}

{"text":"Renting a downtown bachelor in a Capreit building. Edit: updated my list with people\u2019s feedback \n\nI\u2019m hoping to move from Toronto to Victoria later this year. I\u2019ve been looking at various affordable-ish buildings that might be a possibility to live in. I\u2019d prefer to live alone, close to downtown, and avoid living in a basement, so one of Capreit\u2019s relatively affordable bachelor units seems like a good option so far.\n\nIn Toronto, most people avoid purpose-built apartment buildings because they are terrible. I did some of my own research, and around 90% of apartment buildings in Toronto have cockroaches, and at leash 50% have or have had bedbugs or other pests. However, from my research so far, apartment buildings in Victoria seem a lot more decent (although I could be be wrong here).  \n\nA few of the buildings I have been considering are: \n\nYes: \nVictor Apartments: 976 Humboldt Street\nVancouver Villa: 710 Vancouver Street\nNiagara Court Apartments: 535 Niagara Street\n\nMaybe: \nAnondale Court: 443 Superior Street\nVilla Apartments: 788-790 Dominion Road\n\nNo: \nGorge Road Apartments: 215-221 Gorge Road East\nGraham House: 1110 Queens Avenue\n\nUnknown: \nValencia Apartments: 660 Niagara Street\nLord Harley: 3220 Quadra Street\n\nOther suggestions:\nContinental House on Lampson Street\n\nI am hoping someone may be able to provide experiences with these specific buildings, or renting from Capreit in general. I am also open to recommendations of other relatively affordable apartment buildings near downtown (ideally pet friendly, as I will likely have a small dog by the time I move). \n\nThanks in advance!","label":1,"Predicted_Label":0}
{"text":"Advice on Small Claims Court Case. We are currently in the following situation concerning a restoration company.\nIn our case we had a small leakage for which we reached out to our insurance for water damage in one of our room\u2019s ceiling.They suggested a restoration company and we decided to go with them. Our place is almost 50 years old so they tested for asbestos in that rooms ceiling which came positive and they did the whole sealing on the room and abatement and everything and cut a hole in the ceiling and said it\u2019s safe now and some other contractor will come to put in the new drywall. The guy who finally came was not briefed properly and started scraping the popcorn ceiling that had the asbestos while we were all home, with the doors open without even wearing a mask himself. We immediately stopped him and called the restoration company and asked them to remediate. We had to take the day off work, left our place, sent off the pets to sitters while we stayed with our friends. It was crazy how negligent they were even after all the asbestos testing and stuff. We thought we should definitely go to small claims against them. But we don\u2019t know what the damages should be. Will it just be the deductible, but this is like negligence that can possibly affect health. How do we put a price on that. We did incur a bunch of other small costs but the inconvenience and the stress is the worst part about it. And will it be the insurance company or the restoration company that we go against.

BC Housing and the Our Place Society are currently running a 50 bed emergency shelter at this site similar to the hotels that they started running over covid, the plan is to convert this former warehouse site in a mixed light-industrial \/ residential area into 40 \"self-contained permanent supportive residential homes\"  with 24\/7 on site staff. Each unit would have its own bathroom and kitchen, and most crucially just be a private space with a lock on the door, which is what a lot of people really need to actually get back on their feet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently a lot of the emails council has received on this have been from neighbours basically saying \"put it somewhere else\" or truly just \"not in my backyard\". I understand that most people would not be crazy  about a supportive housing facility being built next door to them, but I think we can all recognize that as a society we need these things and if we killed every project because a neighbour objected then we'd get nothing built in the end. We know that concentrating all the social housing and social services in the city in one neighbourhood leads to bad outcomes, it concentrates poverty, makes most people just avoid that area, and leads to exactly what we have in some parts of downtown and Harris Green currently. If you had a drug addiction you were trying to recover from or mental health issues that were seriously affecting your life you probably wouldn't do too well if the only supportive housing you were offered was right on the 900 block of Pandora, we have to give people the opportunity to get out of that environment, and housing facilities like this do exactly that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo please, sit down after work today for five minutes and type out an email to council. You can send your letter to [mayorandcouncil@victoria.ca](mailto:mayorandcouncil@victoria.ca) and it will be forwarded to all councillors and the mayor, as well as being published permanently in the agenda for Thursday's meeting with your email redacted (though nothing else is). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* You should include the address of the site (225 Russell Street) in the subject line of your email\n* Start with saying you want them to support the project\n* Be professional, polite, and say **why** you want them to support the project\n* Sign off with your actual name, and if you want your address or just the neighbourhood you live in\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo please, if you've ever complained on here about homelessness in the city, about the housing crisis, or about \"the state of downtown!\" actually write in to council on this project, because I guarantee it will do more than just talking about the issues here.

We have asked to open a dialogue with her and have offered our assistance in developing a strategy to deal with the current situation and to assist with developing plans moving forward concerning the management of the greenspace as it relates to the homeless population.\n\n>For example, every morning when the VicPD awaken homeless persons in the parks this provides us with opportunities to assess many things such as their exposure level to the elements, mental health status, physical health status, and many other vulnerabilities. We connect them at these times with mental health teams, connect them with housing providers, at times take them to hospital, or call the ambulance if they need immediate medical attention, in addition to that, because they are on City property, the Parks Department comes and deans up accumulated garbage, needles, and human waste. The public works department then hauls all of that away to be disposed of properly.\n\n>Because the space they currently occupy is not on City property none of that management outlined above is happening. In effect, if the people there are allowed to continue to occupy the space, unabated, unrestrained and unmanaged it will be akin to actually creating greater vulnerabilities for them. The likelihood of an assault, overdose, exposure or other incident occurring increases as the population grows without arty form of management.\n\n>One other point that was communicated to ADM Cavanaugh through Ms. Melvin was that there is green space in City Parks available all over the City. The people that are taking shelter on the grounds of the Courthouse are not doing so because there is nowhere for them to go. it is our experienced belief that they are taking up sheltering on that space because they are not being compelled to pack up every morning and move off the grounds.\n>As we have communicated our concerns to ADM Cavanaugh in writing the VicPD, respectfully will not be taking any action until we have received a response from her directly.\n>May I ask whether there has been communication between the two Ministries you've outlined below with respect to this issue been initiated?\n\n>Regards,\n>Scott\n\n>Inspector Scott McGregor\n>Focused Enforcement Team Victoria Police Department","label":1,"Predicted_Label":0}

For me, I only saw it through the lens of seeing Tent Cities from the double decker 50 or 61 and by bike, with time I also sourced information from coworkers and the news. But after talking to the volunteers and leaders at Our Place, as well as some nurses working for similar organizations, my perspective broadened to the point where I myself can see the lack of publicly available information regarding pressing issues and the general topic of homelessness in Victoria. \n\nSo if you're interested in having an \"Ask me Anything\" with some of the leaders and volunteers at Our Place Society, let me know in the poll and depending on the interest I may be able to convince a few of them to frequently check a formal reddit post on the topic (will also need to check with moderators about how to best organize this event). Thanks, stay safe, stay healthy folks.\n\n[View Poll](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/poll\/k030ge)","label":1,"Predicted_Label":0}

{"text":"Off-Duty Officer Attacked While Volunteering. https:\/\/vicpd.ca\/2021\/09\/14\/off-duty-officer-attacked-while-volunteering\/\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 14, 2021\n\nFile: 21-37515\n\nVictoria, BC \u2013 An off-duty VicPD officer suffered non-life-threatening injuries after she was attacked while volunteering in Victoria yesterday.\n\nAt approximately 12:30 p.m. yesterday afternoon an off-duty VicPD officer was volunteering her time to walk a dog in the 500-block of David Street when she was randomly approached by an unknown woman. The woman was agitated and acting erratically, and accused the officer of stealing the dog she was walking. The woman then physically attacked the off-duty officer. A struggle ensued that went to the ground and the suspect struck the officer several times, including violently kicking the officer several times while she was on the ground. The suspect then fled the area.\n\nThe officer did not require medical treatment at the scene. She was off-duty and recovering from a life-altering injury sustained nearly two years ago after being assaulted by a suspect during a different police incident.\n\nPatrol officers responded to the incident and located the suspect a short distance away from the scene. Officers arrested the suspect without further incident.\n\nThe suspect was transported to VicPD cells where she was later released with a court date and conditions. She will face recommended charges of assault.\n\nIn British Columbia, the decision to release a person is based on the likelihood they will attend court, the risk posed to public safety, and the impact on confidence in the criminal justice system.  In addition, Bill C-75, which came into effect nationally in 2019, has legislated a \u201cprinciple of restraint\u201d that requires police to release an accused person at the earliest possible opportunity after considering these factors. This is founded in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that every person has the right to liberty and the presumption of innocence pre-trial.  Police are also asked to consider the circumstances of Indigenous or vulnerable person in the process, in order to address the disproportionate impacts that the criminal justice system has on these populations.\n\nThis file remains under investigation.\n\nIf you have information about this incident, please call our non-emergency line at (250) 995-7654. To report what you know anonymously, please call Greater Victoria Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.","label":1,"Predicted_Label":0}

{"text":"You can affect housing change. I see a lot of posts and people that are very critical of the current state of housing in Victoria. I just want to remind everyone that City Councils are basically all powerful on housing change in Victoria and the surrounding municipalities. For more housing to be built, single-family lots need to be rezoned to allow more units and for any rezoning, they require years of consultation and approvals. 65% of Victoria is zoned for single family homes, and it's way higher for Oak Bay and Saanich. There is no housing growth without these being upzoned and allowing walkups, townhouses, etc. Demand is steadily increasing while supply stays the same. \n\nIf you are upset about the lack of housing being built\/allowed to be built, please email letters to mayor and council in all municipalities that are lacking on housing.

{"text":"Need help with a mental health issue. Hey all, thanks for reading. I don't know where else to turn at this point. Sorry for the wall of text. \n\nMy aunt has tried to kill herself. The first time was May 2013. It came as a shock to our family. \n\nShe is in her 50's, but due to lack of oxygen at birth she was developmentally delayed. I don't know how best to describe her. She can function as an adult in some ways, but in others she is like a child. She has tantrums like a toddler at times, and has poor ability to grasp consequences. She has a lot of trouble expressing herself. She has always lived with my grandmother, who is now in her late 80's and is in denial about the situation with her daughter. \n\nA month or so ago, my aunt tried to kill herself again. Both times were by taking pills. We told grandma that all pills have to be kept from my aunt, but my grandma seems to think that my aunt is just behaving like a bratty child. She can't seem to grasp the seriousness and isn't making much of an effort to keep the drugs secured. \n\nThe first overdose was worse than the second. It really messed up her body. She was in hospital for several days, and then was sent home. Since then, she has had tinnitus (or something similar) that is causing her to basically lose her mind. She goes to the emergency room every week or two. She sees her family doctor or clinic doctors on a weekly basis. They keep *fucking* prescribing pills!!! All she wants is for the noises in her head to go away. There is nothing medically wrong with her that can be detected at this point (she has had all sorts of tests, MRIs, etc). \n\nAfter the attempt last month, she told us she wants to go into a care facility. The problem is that she doesn't qualify for one. After the first OD she was clearly in a major state of depression. She wouldn't talk to anyone anymore. After the second attempt, things seemed better. I thought maybe it is because she thought she would get the help she wants\/needs, but now I'm not so sure. I worry that she has made up her mind to die, and that is what is making her feel better. \n\nI just found out that she tried to drink chemicals a few days ago, but my grandma stopped her. \n\nWe are at a loss. She can't talk to counsellors because she doesn't understand that they're not there to help with the tinnitus. She just babbles about her head. We truly believe that she will keep trying to kill herself until she succeeds. We don't know how to keep her safe. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? Can we have her committed? Hospital staff seem completely unwilling to do anything other than prescribe pills and send her home. We are desperate to help her. I've posted enough info here for my friends\/acquaintances to recognize me, but I don't know where else to turn. \n\nThank you. ","label":0,"Predicted_Label":0}

I sit there for minutes watching car by car drive by not stopping. It\u2019s ridiculous... \n\nPeople making turns while I\u2019m crossing the street just BARELY missing me, not okay. \n\nThere is no reason important enough to drive like an ahole and hit someone. \n\nPlease be respectful of everybody on the road, drivers AND pedestrians.\n\nSaying this I do recognize that there are less than favourable pedestrians here as well. My point is it is a lot safer for everyone if we stay aware and respectful of everyone both drivers and pedestrians","label":0,"Predicted_Label":0}
{"text":"Warning to cat owners in the saanichton peninsula-. There seems to be someone going around and killing cats down by Mt. Newton\/Lochside area. I hate having to make this post as I know animal abuse can be really upsetting to people but I feel the need to warn others.\n\nI know 5 people thus far, 1 of which being family, who have had their indoor\/outdoor cats murdered in nefarious ways by an unknown person. We have found multiple bodies, and I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail because the whole thing is literally making me sick to my stomach\u2026I\u2019ve been puking on and off for weeks since finding out. There\u2019s also been an uptick in missing cat posters which I feel could be related given the bodies we\u2019ve found.\n\nAlso *please* don\u2019t turn this post into a debate about why people shouldn\u2019t let their cats outdoors. I fully agree that it\u2019s dangerous for the cats, bad for the ecosystem\/small bird population, etc. \n\nThis is strictly supposed to be a PSA to cat owners within the area that let their kitties outdoors. \n\nSomething similar was going on in the keating area about a decade ago and then it seemed to stop so I had just assumed the person responsible moved locations. \n\nNot trying to scare people, just want to warn others and try to inform cat owners in the saanichton area.

But one cat was shot with pellets and the another was drowned in a sack. So there\u2019s a possibility it could be a mixture of both? Either way I just wanted to warn people so that they could bring their cats inside if possible.\n\nI appreciate everyone taking the time to comment.

{"text":"Investigators have released a photo of the second longboard stolen in that playground robbery that left a youth with potentially life-threatening injuries last week. Officers were called to the playground in the 3100-block of Alder Street just before 9 p.m. on Tuesday, May 1st where they discovered the victim nearby. The victim, a male youth, reported that he and a friend were in the playground when two other males unknown to them approached and took their longboards. When the victim approached the two males who had taken their longboards, he was assaulted with a weapon. \n \nThe unprovoked assault left the male youth with non-life-threatening, but potentially life-altering injuries. He remains in treatment for his injuries. The two other males then left the scene with the stolen longboards.\n \nThe suspects are described as two Aboriginal male youths, approximately 15 and 16 years old. Both were described as being short, standing about 5\u20193\u201d tall and of average build. One of the suspects was wearing a red hat at the time of the incident. Our investigators continue to search for these suspects.\n\nA photograph of the second longboard that was taken by the suspects was released today. This longboard is described as an arrow-head shaped board, with a wood-grain patina. The board has hand-written lettering near the front wheels on top and a distinctive \u201c49\u201d sticker on the wheels near the bottom. The board also had thick yellow wheels. A photograph of the board is below.\n\nhttps:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Dc3YVBGU0AA7L7M.jpg\n \nHave you seen this longboard?\n \nThe other longboard stolen is also distinctive. It is described as being a full-sized board, with dark grey grip tape on top with a circular black and white sticker in the middle. The underside is described as dark blue, white, grey and aquamarine pattern, with a smaller black circular sticker. This longboard is brand new. A photograph of the top and bottom of the longboard is below.\n \nhttps:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Dc38ujTV4AE4_ep.jpg\n \nHave you seen this longboard?\n\n \nThis file remains under investigation and we will continue to release further details as we have them.\n \nAdditionally, witnesses report that a man offered assistance to the victim as he lay on the ground. This man did not remain on scene to speak with investigators and officers need to speak with him. We have not yet located this man and are asking this man to contact our investigators as he may have information about the suspects.\n \nIf you have any information about this incident, recognize either of these longboards, or believe you may know the suspects\u2019 identities, please call our non-emergency line at (250) 995-7654.

My yoga bra was still wet at home so I just wore a shirt. Got into the yoga room it was much hotter than the previous yoga the day before. I was like I cannot do this in a shirt way too hot. See all these shirtless guys. I go to the front desk and ask if I can do it topless, was told that I could and even got a laugh and they were amused by the request. I do its all good.  Survive yoga.

I ask if she saw anyone being distracted said that its not common and people did a few looks. I did not press the issue.\n\nI ponder issue.Think FUCK THAT!ITs not on me for other people to not sexualize my bodyI find other peoples boners, abs and tattoos are distracting but it's on the individual to not sexualize people not to shame women.\n\nThis is not equality.Will talk with the owner tomorrow I did not make an issue of it today just not right time and place.SO my plan is to talk to them tomorrow, then have another woman or two that also want to do topless yoga with me for support.Its about the principle.\n\nAnother person would be helpful, also its a bit nerve wracking for me so some support would be good.

Requested to attend class again tonight with the same rights as a man, to go shirtless.

{"text":"Empire Donuts and Fried Chicken thoughts?. Been a long time fan of their Donuts location on Yates so i decided to check out their new business. Here are my thoughts so far\n\nLocation 8\/10 - The old liquor store in Cook street village behind Prima Strada. Hot spot area but its quite hidden.\n\nParking  5\/10 - Kinda crappy actually, There is a pay lot directly infront of it and no free spots. Street parking in the area is often difficult. Still much better than their downtown location.\n\nStaff 8\/10 - Friendly and helpful\n\nSignage 4\/10 - Honestly it is hard to spot. perhaps they should have a light on their sign indicating dounts r in stock :(\n\nSeating  1\/10 - Not a comfortable place to eat in. Two high top small round table with 4 extra small stools surround. Basically a takeout restaurant. Not family friendly at all.\n\nStore and atmosphere 2\/10 - The look and colors are ok but the place is underlit on a cold rainy day. No music and line moves very slow as people hum and haw over donuts.\n\nFood 9\/10 - Honestly their chicken was good ( better than thunderbird chicken 1 block away) and the waffle fries great. I topped it off with a donut to end which was outstanding.\n\nPrice 1\/10 - For 2 piece chicken and waffle fries plus one dount and rootbeer it cost me $25. Too me that is ridiculous. To top off they hand u the meal in a takeout box regardless of eating in. I can have a great topclass meal for $25 at a sitdown restaurant with a full waiter staff topping up my water every second and handing me free bread with an actual plate to eat on.\n\nHours 3\/10 - They are only open till 3pm which kinda sucks. Another thing that sucks is that they run out of donuts often and sometimes by noon which sucks. Going out of your way to go to a local donut shop but seeing a sold out sign at noon makes me not want to come back especially if I just paid for parking.\n\nOverall 6.5\/10 - It has potential if they adjusted some things, get some dedicated parking,get some booths inside and optimize seating, played some music, offered some more beverage options, offer combo deals and reduce the price.\n\nWill this place survive? I am not sure. With stiff competition in the area like big wheel burger, prima strata and newly opened Thunderbird fried chicken better valued good chicken) just a block away they will have to really be on the ball. They will heavily rely on their donut sales to stay in business.\n\n\n\n","label":0,"Predicted_Label":0}
