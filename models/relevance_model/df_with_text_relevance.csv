https://www.timescolonist.com/we-ll-get-a-railway-up-and-running-says-island-corridor-foundation-1.23991959

*Lindsay Kines / Times Colonist*

**We’ll get a railway up and running, says Island Corridor Foundation**

The Island Corridor Foundation remains optimistic that rail service will be restored to Vancouver Island despite endless studies and “analysis paralysis” within the provincial government, says the foundation’s CEO.

In a presentation to Esquimalt council, Larry Stevenson said the province’s ongoing assessment of the E&N rail corridor and the costs associated with bringing it up to current standards shows more promise than he initially thought.

“I was very vocal at the time when they came out with this as it being just another study,” he said. “But I have to say I’m cautiously optimistic.

“In fact, I was pleasantly surprised when they brought the team out that is doing the assessment. These are railroad people. These are people that have worked for CP [Canadian Pacific] for 40 years. They’re people that know track. They know how to rebuild track.”

Stevenson said one “point of caution” is that the foundation has had minimal input in the study. The non-profit foundation owns the rail line that runs north from Victoria to Courtenay and west to Port Alberni. Passenger service ceased in 2011 amid safety concerns about the track. “The scary part is that at the beginning of this, they told us that they were doing this to determine if rail is even required,” he said. “We’re hopeful that we’re not just simply kicking the can down the road.”

The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure said in a statement Tuesday that it expects to have the results of its engineering assessment of the corridor by the end of the year.

“The province has committed to an ‘all-in’ assessment to determine the costs associated with restoring rail service on Vancouver Island,” the statement said. “This work will include looking at the entire corridor, including the line to Port Alberni. This also includes the cost of imperative safety work, a seismic risk assessment and complete rock-fall review to ensure any potential passenger rail service meets current day safety standards.

“This assessment is necessary before any decisions are made around investing significant public dollars along the Island Rail Corridor.”

In February, the capital region’s 13 mayors urged immediate action to get passenger trains running on the E&N Rail line from Langford to Victoria as a first step toward restoring service across the Island.

In open letters to Premier John Horgan, the mayors noted that there was overwhelming support for rail at an E&N stakeholder meeting in December 2018.

Esquimalt Mayor Barb Desjardins, a CRD representative on the Island Corridor Foundation’s board, said in an interview Tuesday that she shares Stevenson’s cautious optimism about the track’s future.

“He’s a railway guy,” she said. “He knows the business. I’m just hopeful that the province will take some time to really understand it.

“With climate emergencies being declared everywhere, it is a better mode of transit if we can get it up and going.”

Stevenson told Esquimalt council that there have been no fewer than 12 studies of the corridor over the years. “I’ve got tell you, I’ve been in the railroad business for 25 years; I’m absolutely convinced this is the most studied piece of track in North America, bar none,” he said.

Multiple studies, however, have created more confusion than clarity, he said. “Part of the reason for that, in my view, is there’s a real lack of expertise and understanding within the [transportation] ministry here in B.C.

“They, to some extent, struggle with analysis paralysis. They build roads. … They’re really good at roads, but rail is pretty complicated in their view, because they don’t build rail. So for them, this is a whole different animal.

“And I’m not taking a shot at them, as much as I’m saying that we don’t have the expertise in-house within the ministry to actually look at rail for what it is.”

Stevenson said the 290-kilometre corridor should be seen as an “amazing” asset for the Island.

“There’s countries and cities and municipalities that would cut their arms off for that,” he said. “On our books, it sits there at $380 million in value. I would suggest to you it’s a lot more than that. You’re probably in the billions of dollars, because you just can’t find a contiguous piece of property like that.”

Stevenson said Island residents and governments can’t afford to squander that and should be looking at the corridor as a way to deal with population increases and the impact of climate change.

“We get caught up in what is it going to be tomorrow,” he said. “But what we really need to be worried about is what’s this going to look like 30 years from today, because if we have issues today, we have huge issues 30 years from now. When you can run a train that has one-third the carbon footprint of a bus, I would suggest we might want to think about running a few more trains.”

VictoriaBC,1337ingDisorder,"BC already has rent-control laws. Maybe it's time for property-tax-control laws too. (From TC: ""Property tax idea from a B.C. senior"") *[Article from the Times Colonist]*

**Comment: Property tax idea from a B.C. senior**

I am a low-income senior living on payments from the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security programs. Every year at this time, I must pay my biggest bill of all, my property taxes.

I live in a modest, older bungalow which matches my income and lifestyle.

After 33 years, my house assessment has dropped by half, but my lot assessment has leaped from $55,000 to $1.2 million even though the lot has not changed. In other words, almost all of the property tax I struggle to pay is due to speculative inflation.

Luckily I, like many of the current flood of retiring baby boomers, qualify for Property Tax Deferment.

Property tax deferment is available to B.C. homeowners who are 55 years or older, a surviving spouse, or eligible persons with disabilities and for homeowners who financially support a dependent child.

When you defer annual property taxes, the province charges interest on the tax deferment loan. The loan rate is 1.2 per cent for the regular program and 3.2 per cent for the families with children.

Deferred taxes and interest are paid when the home is sold or transferred.

PTD has kept me out of the clutches of the reverse-mortgage loan sharks.

Unfortunately the PTD is just a Band-Aid solution rather than part of any cure to the underlying problems.

In California, Proposition 13 has made a difference.

A big component to Proposition 13 was the idea that older Californians should not be priced out of their homes through high taxes.

Enacted in 1978, it decreased property taxes by assessing values at their 1976 value and restricted annual increases of assessed value of property to an inflation factor, not to be more than two per cent per year. It also prohibited reassessment of a new base year value, except if ownership changed or there had been new construction.

There is a built-in fairness to this cure. Why should residents who have paid taxes for 30 or 40 years to keep a town desirable, pay as much current tax as new owners wanting to take advantage of that desirability?

Come on B.C., enough already with Band-Aids such as PTD and secondary suites.We need a permanent cure.

Article text:

When police stopped Evan Laine while he was riding his electric scooter on Finlayson Street to hand him a $600 ticket, the officer was unmoved by pleas to let it go with a warning.

Laine had only just bought the machine and hadn’t installed the pedals. As far as the officer was concerned, the absence of pedals meant the machine was a motor scooter and required a licence plate and insurance.

“When I bought the scooter, the pedals were under the seat and not installed on the bike,” Laine said. “I asked him if he could just let it go with a warning.”

“ ‘Absolutely not,’ ” was the answer.

Laine took the ticket to court and it was tossed out. In July, a provincial court judge ruled he couldn’t uphold a penalty for not having insurance when ICBC offers no such insurance for a machine like Laine’s.

Laine had ridden his electric scooter into a tricky, sometimes confusing, area of rules governing battery-powered electric vehicles showing up on Victoria streets.

In his case, the problem arose over the question: “Just when does an electric-motor-assisted cycle become a limited-speed motorcycle?”

His electric scooter is classified as “motor-assisted cycle” and is allowed on the road, according to B.C. regulations.

The rules state the motor must be electric, have no more power than 500 watts and be capable of going no faster than 32 km/h without pedalling. Anyone 16 or older wearing a bicycle helmet can ride one and neither licence plates nor insurance are needed.

Rules also state the motor must disengage when the rider stops pedalling or releases the accelerator or applies the brake.

The “stops pedalling” provision becomes confusing when it’s paired with others that say “it is not necessary to always be pedalling.”

Even the 32 km/h limit without pedalling is confusing. Why specify the machine goes only so fast “without pedalling” if the motor must disengage the moment pedalling stops?

Also, as in Laine’s case, some motor-assisted cycles look like motor scooters, those zippy little machines usually built with a big cowling on the front. Motor scooters are classified as “limited-speed motorcycles” and they are a different breed. Their motors are restricted to no more than 50 cc for gasoline or 1.5 kW for electric, and a top speed of 70 km/h. Limited-speed motorcycles require a driver’s licence of any class, registration, plates and insurance.

But motor-assisted cycles, whether they look like a motor scooter or not, are different. There must be no gas engines. The motor must be electric. It must be capable of being propelled with muscles using pedals. It must, however, be incapable of motoring off from a dead stop, hence the pedals.

Another rule stipulates the machine must be at a speed of at least three km/h before its motor engages.

It’s not just electric bicycles and electric scooters that are appearing on B.C. streets. Other electric vehicles have appeared and been chased away by government regulations. Already banned on roads and sidewalks are electric push scooters, electric skateboards and self-balancing boards or hoverboards, according to the Insurance Corp. of B.C.

The B.C. government is examining new transportation technologies. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Transportation said government initiatives such as Clean B.C. and Move Commute Connect will consider how best to update regulations to deal with new transport technologies.

“The province is currently evaluating the legislative, regulatory and policy frameworks to ensure they help support and acknowledge all road users and emerging active transportation modes,” said a ministry statement.

The Capital Regional District is also dealing with electric transport, such as motor-assisted cycles.

Jeff Leahy, senior manager of CRD Parks, said electric motor-assisted cycles are allowed on the trails such as the Galloping Goose.

But park workers might stop them to make sure they conform to the rules, usually by making sure they have working pedals.

Some trails in some wilderness parks, depending on their management plans, allow back-country, motor-assisted cycles.

Motor-assisted cycles have become popular in mountain-bike circles.

Leahy said riders are expected to show caution and courtesy.

“We have multiple-use trails where cyclists should be encouraged to slow down,” he said.

“We have multiple users out there like children, walkers, hikers, dogs, etc.”

Kelly Goldbeck, owner of KGeez Cycle, has been in business for years selling electric cycles and scooters.

Goldbeck said he has heard major manufacturers, such as Yamaha, are gearing up to release new electric scooters that will compete in speed with the gas-powered motor scooters now licensed for B.C. roads. He plans to sell them.

He said public concerns over carbon emissions and other pollutants will ensure electric bicycles, electric scooters and other forms of electric transport become more common.

“Electric is not going to go away,” said Goldbeck. “It’s on the upsurge big time.”",front line worker,1,False,0.0

**Olympian Adam Kreek offers to row Greta Thunberg to Victoria**

Teen climate activist says: 'I don’t know anything about an invitation to Victoria, and I have definitely not declined it because of “emissions” from the public transport ferry'

*Louise Dickson , Lindsay Kines / Times Colonist*

*OCTOBER 23, 2019 06:00 AM*

Adam Kreek can easily imagine a flotilla of boats paddling teen climate-change activist Greta Thunberg across the strait to Victoria on Saturday.

When the Olympic gold medallist rower learned Thunberg would be in Vancouver Friday but had passed on the opportunity to visit Vancouver Island because the ferries run on fossil fuels, Kreek immediately offered to row the teenager across the water.

“Greta is just a beacon of hope who unites people,” Kreek said Tuesday. “Greta has been able to cut through the noise. She’s been able to get the message out that the climate is hurting and we need to take action. A number of people have already told me they’re interested in joining the flotilla.”

Thunberg has people travelling with her who will also need a fossil-free trip to Victoria, he said. “So we could figure out a way to make that happen. I think we could have a lot of fun with it.”

Kreek, his wife Rebecca and many others are holding their breath waiting to see what Thunberg decides. “It really depends on Greta’s schedule. It’s an offer. It’s out there. It’s in Greta’s camp. We have enough time to get rowboats over to Vancouver.”

“I think we could bring her over on Saturday and bring her where she needs to go on Sunday, maybe down to Seattle,” said Kreek.

On a windswept dock at the Inner Harbour, Kreek walked over to the Whitehall Spirit rowing shell that could be used to bring her here.

“We’d probably sit her in the stern and there would be two of us rowing. I wouldn’t expect Greta to row at all, but I would expect her to dress warmly. A survival suit would be good, especially this time of year.”

Kreek estimates the trip could take four to eight hours.

“Saturday will be windy, but manageable, so it will be adventurous,” said Kreek with a laugh. “We’d want to start early because the weather is always better in the morning. Sailboats would be easy to get her across too. So we shall see.”

Kreek, whose hands are roughened by blisters and callouses, is still training and competing and up to the challenge. “You put these things out there and you put your hand up there to say: ‘I can help’ and if it helps, it helps.”

Coun. Ben Isitt said he reached out to a contact in Vancouver last week, inquiring about Thunberg visiting Vancouver Island. “The main obstacle that was identified at that point was the lack of a fossil-fuel free transportation option. With Kreek’s offer, Thunberg and her team are considering a visit, he said.

Isitt said he, like many other people, would be “honoured” to welcome Thunberg. “Greta Thunberg is leader of a worldwide movement demanding a more sustainable economy and society. She’s hugely inspirational to myself and tens of thousands of residents of the region.”

Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps, who was among those inviting Thunberg to the Island, applauded the teen for standing on principle. “I think it really speaks to the reason that she’s touring around the world in a zero-carbon way,” Helps said.

“She and literally millions of young people around the world are fighting for their future and asking us adults to take that seriously. I think it’s almost poignant that she would come and see us, but for the fossil fuels that she’d need to burn to get here.”

Helps praised, as well, the community’s efforts to rally behind Thunberg and try to overcome the obstacles that prevent her from visiting. “It does again speak to the creativity and innovation of Victorians that someone is literally willing to row her there and we confirmed he will also row her back, so she won’t be stranded here.

“I hope that she and the team she is working with will be inspired by the energy and enthusiasm that Vancouver Islanders have, to have this young dynamo come and join us here for a while.”

Climate activist Emma-Jane Burian, 17, of Victoria said she hopes Kreek’s proposal works out. “All I know is that they offered, and the mayor of Victoria and the mayor of Saanich echoed that and said we would be really grateful if she could come through the means of rowing.”

B.C. Green Party Leader Andrew Weaver said he extended an invitation to the 16-year-old Swede to speak in the legislature. He has spoken to Speaker Darryl Plecas, who has agreed to allow Thunberg to address the legislature if she is willing, Weaver said.

Adding some confusion to the situation, this message was posted to Thunberg’s social media accounts late Tuesday:

VictoriaBC,1337ingDisorder,"Remember the LRAD scandal from a decade or so ago? Might that legislation not be effective against the honkies? So a little over a decade ago there was a big scandal in Ontario over police using sonic weapons to disperse protesters at the G20 summit.

Part of me wonders why those LRAD devices weren't used for the recent Ottawa protest, given I assume OPP still owns the devices. 

But that's a tangent thought — my main thought is that there was a court battle over their use, and legislation was created to regulate them. Was that legislation specific to the LRAD devices, or might it apply more broadly? Are there any other laws against sonic weapons in Canada? 

I'm wondering if this weaponized honking — and it very much is being used as a weapon, with malicious intent to cause distress — might not just be a violation of Victoria's new bylaw, but might actually constitute a federal crime.

Island Farms used to be pretty much just ice cream too but now their ingredients list is also half additives and volume-fillers.

I've looked at a few other brands in grocery stores and they all seem to be padded with filler ingredients too. It's like all the commercial ice cream brands have started taking their cues from sketchy nightclub coke dealers. Yuck.

I've bought a machine to make it at home, and it's really good (the only ingredients are cream, sugar, yolks, and then flavouring stuff like blackberry jelly or chocolate or whatever). And really it's not all that much of a hassle, but still would be nice to know at least one or two brands I could buy in a store when I'm feeling lazy.

Are there any brands left that still sell pure ice cream? Or are they literally *all* selling product that's been stepped on/cut/buffed with filler materials?",WiN,0,False,37.5
VictoriaBC,1337ingDisorder,"Supplementary Chinese take-out question — specifically asking people who remember the chow mein at East Garden back before the new ownership took over (ie, pre-2013ish I think) Another user posted asking for current suggestions on decent westernized Chinese food. It's inspired me to see if anyone can recommend a place that offers something very specific.

If you've only lived in Victoria for a few years this post isn't for you.

But if you used to order from East Garden back before it got sold to new owners circa 2013ish (or maybe some time between 2011 and 2014?) then you might be able to help me with my quest.

I remember for years and years East Garden had the best chow mein in town, by a wide margin. They used noodles that were really flat and had a great texture to them when cooked properly. I remember them being darker as well, although that might have just been due to being better at absorbing the sauce or something like that.

When the place got sold (or at least I think it got sold — maybe just a management change?) the menu stayed the same, but a bunch of the ingredients got changed and the quality of virtually everything on the menu went way downhill, to the point that it was no longer even worth ordering from them.

The chow mein noodles in particular basically got swapped out for what seemed comparable to cheap ramen you find in the discount generic off-brand packets. The texture of the noodles was less rich and more doughy — like the old noodles had a kind of almost elasticity to them whereas the new ones had an almost play-doh kind of texture. The new noodles were more of a round shape than flat, and overall it was just terrible. Like going from real pizza to a frozen pizza-pop.

In the following couple years I tried ordering from a bunch of different places around town, looking for a suitable replacement, but it seemed like around that time every other place must have switched to the cheap noodles too as all I could find anywhere were places serving chow mein with round doughy noodles. I found one place that had flat-ish noodles, almost like the shape of pad thai noodles but still the size of chow mein noodles, but they ended up being just as grainy/doughy as the round ones everyone else seems to have, and weren't anything like the really flat ones East Garden used to serve way back when.

So, TL;DR: Anyone who remembers the good chow mein East Garden used to serve before the ingredients got sabotaged — have you found any place in town that serves the kind of chow mein that EG used to offer back in the day?

Or even better — does anyone know the specific brand of chow mein noodles East Garden used to use back then? I'd prefer to be able to make it myself than to have to shell out 10x the cost for someone else to do it.",Point in Time,0,False,43.47826086956522
VictoriaBC,1337ingDisorder,"TC: Legal marijuana will make Canada safer From the Times Colonist:

- - - - -

**Legal marijuana will make Canada safer**

On July 1, 2018, marijuana is going to be legalized in Canada. However, there is no need to fear. In fact, Canadians should feel more at ease as July 1 approaches.

Legalization means many things for Canadians. Once a substance is legalized, it directly and aggressively hemorrhages revenue from the black market. When criminal organizations lose money, they lose power. When they lose power, they lose their ability to negatively affect society.

This will be akin to what occurred when prohibition ceased in the United States. All these criminal organizations lost their power and wealth once alcohol was re-legalized. Legalization, in turn, made society at large safer and more hospitable.

Marijuana is commonly, but incorrectly, called “a gateway drug.” This so-called “gateway effect” is caused by the black market. This is because drug dealers who sell weed typically sell a variety of other substances as well. The dealers then offer to sell these other substances to their buyers.

This environment is what causes people to try different narcotics, not marijuana itself. When marijuana is legalized, and people no longer need to seek out shady dealers, it is likely that the testing of more serious substances will dramatically decline.

So, Canadians, do not fear, a safer Canada is near.

I relocated to Vancouver right before Covid from the East Coast, for what was supposed to be a temporary stay before moving over to your fair city, but factors with friends, family, and the plagues left us rooted here for the last three years. 

Everyone talks about how beautiful Vancouver is, a world class city et al, but I find it incredibly ugly and inaccessible, save for a few pockets here and there, like Gastown. The architecture, for the most part is dismal and depressing. Glass high rises do not impress me. Cafes, markets, and stores here seem soulless, except for a few solitary standouts. The harbour as lovely as it is, is not the ocean.

This communication and tone I've heard over the last few days working through some issues has been a total 180 in comparison to previous management and I feel really hopeful for the future of this space. This post has probably come late, especially considering that anyone joining now would not have to deal with the previous staff where 90% of my frustration is directed at. I should have waited to see how the new team is working and considered more that anyone joining now, and as stated by Sarah, would not be here through the growing pains. I don't think my experience in the first quarter of my lease will be experienced by someone moving in now. 

**Tl;dr: I moved in at the beginning when (imo) the staff were rude and didn't care, and had to deal with all the growing pains of the building. As well I think I've just had a bad string of luck with things. In the last few days I've interacted more with the new staff and my mood has really turned around.  They seem 100% more professional and engaged with tenants (ex. really quick and helpful turnaround with emails and *way* more open and transparent). If you're interested, I'd encourage you to get a tour and see if the niche this place provides would be suitable for you. I don't think any these problems would have happened had the current staff been here from the start.**
_______________________________
I wrote this for another thread but I figured since it is a month old people might miss it. I'm holding back some details because I don't want to make this living arrangement even worse.

________

Thinking about getting a cool trendy microsuite downtown? Don't do it, the place is a shit show. Here's a list of bullshit I've dealt with.

No consistency in units. I've been to a few other rooms and there is such a HUGE difference between all of them. I have no fucking clue what the names on the website mean. There's a room I saw that felt almost twice the size of mine and it was the same price! (Apparently lots of tenants were shown multiple rooms. I was shown two, the one I was told I'd live in and some showroom for the $1000+ suites. Turns out the I was shown got rented before me so I went into the place blind. I guess that might be my fault for not putting my foot down and seeing other places but I was told they were all the same.)

Random emergencies. A couple times the water has randomly shut off, false fire evacuation a month ago, random power outage this month (apparently someone broke into the lobby and turned the power off for the whole building. How the fuck is that even possible?!)

Water issues galore. There are a lot of water issues. Leaks, no hot water, hot water taking ten+ mins to come, hot water out of cold tap and vice versa, hot water so hot it scalds you, and there's a few places in the halls where you can see water pooling behind the latex paint.

Anything that can break, has broke. The brand new oven in my unit has broken multiple times. I got the hot plate for my room *at the end of October* and it was broken out of the box. I've mostly given up on making food at home. I've had less problems in places that haven't been reno'd since before I was born.

They didn't finish construction *in my room* till weeks after I moved in. I was told my place came with a table attached to my wall but it was weeks (maybe over a month) till I got it. On top of that, the table is 44in by **14in**. All I could do was laugh after I got home from work to see it. When I have someone over,  we're eating like we're at a tiny window bar in a dinner.

There is no communal office space or communal TV room. Both spaces where they should be have been stuffed with random things since I moved in.

The place is no pets but idk if that's enforced? I see people with dogs occasionally and I think I heard a cat once. If you're really allergic this might pose a problem as the hallways are carpeted.

Rotating door of staff. I've lived here since the start of september and they've gone through three different sets of staff. Maybe the third time will be the charm? 

This might not be a problem with the new staff but the previous staff have made me very sure to suggest to my LGBT friends to stay away.

Again, this might not be problem anymore with the new *new* staff, but previous staff have lied through their teeth in almost every interaction with me. 

* I was told the communal kitchen was free access (it's not, you have to email management and book a time)

* The suite would have pots and pans included (nope)

* A wardrobe would be included (noooope)

* TV and TV mount would be installed a few weeks after move in (TV was a lie, I was then told it'd be a monthly rental thing for the TV but the mount would be free still to put my own TV up. Turns out *that* was a lie as well and it's $50/month for both or nothing)

* Secure bike parking and lockers would be set up in a few weeks after I move in. (not a thing apparently? They instead installed a bike hook in my room *last week* so I have the joy of even less space in my tiny place)

* I was told there were no Traveller suites left, so I've been paying $75 more a month for a Wool. (turns out there are *still* some available *over three months later* and one I saw is **bigger** than my place!)

The walls are also thin, but the building is 151 years old you can't really expect anything else.

The site also mentions a Resident Perk Card, but I've never heard had a mention of it. That's not really a big deal imo because I don't expect a reward card for living somewhere but just be aware of it. (We did get an email about the MODO car in the FOO parking lot and getting some discount code for that)

If you are looking for a good deal, lots of room, a kitchen, are queer/trans (?? could be a 180 with new staff), or enjoy not knowing when your neighbor is showering or having sex, it might be worth looking somewhere else.

All said and done, I got this place because I was desperate and hate roommates. Moving in at this point you might have missed most of the storm. If living downtown is your #1 priority, or you don't have a car, then it might be a good choice. 

(***lol jk***, I'm $1200+ (900 for the extra rent I was cheated into paying, 300+ for the shit I had to buy that I was told was included)  more in student loan debt because of their bullshit)  Edit: added more money b/c I forgot I had to buy a wardrobe for my clothes

However, she was getting push back from suites and hotels that she had contacted individually, saying they didn't want her to contaminate their suites either.

Once she posted on a social media group designed to connect people with help they need during the crisis, she received more offers than she could handle and accepted an offer from a couple volunteers to organize and expand the project to help other essential staff.

The project isn't just for nurses, care aids and doctors - it's for anyone who might be at risk (admin, cafeteria, etc) and wants to stay in a place that's not their family home for the duration of the outbreak.

Unfortunately, to make staff and council feel empowered to act on these wants and needs people need to actively reach out to them via emails, phone calls, meetings etc. This was clear when a group of people pushed council/staff to knock 400 units off the Roundhouse development. Despite them getting voted in to build more housing, they still feel the need to address concerns from people that simply don't want to see multifamily dwellers in their skyline. We need more car free streets for people, we need more housing for people, we need less cars that kill people, we need wider sidewalks and more trees. Let your respective council know!!","Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness , Victoria Women in Need",1,True,0.0
VictoriaBC,93Cracker,"Greater Victoria housing needs by municipality As homes are selling for hundreds of thousands over asking and demand is at an all-time high, the local housing advocates, Homes for Living YYJ, have created these graphics showing the housing needs per municipality vs what is being built. These graphics show the housing units municipalities need to build annually in order to eliminate the housing deficit in the next 10 years. 

It appears Langford is building much more housing than needed, but of course, that’s not really the case as they’re absorbing all the growth the others are pushing out. This has resulted in forests being wiped clean, sprawl, and packed highways. 

It is very eye-opening seeing the numbers and how far off the core municipalities are. Every year that goes by, the annual need increases.

VictoriaBC,93Cracker,"Victoria Housing Affordability There are clearly a lot of people upset about the affordability of housing in this city. I'm among the large majority that see friends moving away because there are no housing options for them. This really boils down to the massive demand for housing in this beautiful city, while the city councils are shutting down any density such as townhouses and 4-6 unit walk-ups. 

My recommendation to everyone that has these opinions is to write to the city councils of Oak Bay, Saanich, and Victoria to express your displeasure with the current situation. If enough people show just how upset they are at the current zoning laws, they might get their butt in gear and change them to be not so exclusionary. All of the emails can be found on the respective municipalities' websites. 

An example of something I personally find unacceptable is that the Victoria City Council is doing a survey for 'gentle density increase', this is part of a plan that goes from !!2016-2025!!. We are in a massive housing affordability crisis where it massively favors those from wealthy families willing to loan money, and that is the timeline for gentle density increase. 

TLDR: If you have complaints about the affordability crisis in Victoria, please email all city councils to express your displeasure with the current housing shortage","Affordable, Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , Social Housing , Victoria Women's Transition House",1,True,55.55555555555556
VictoriaBC,93Cracker,"You can affect housing change I see a lot of posts and people that are very critical of the current state of housing in Victoria. I just want to remind everyone that City Councils are basically all powerful on housing change in Victoria and the surrounding municipalities. For more housing to be built, single-family lots need to be rezoned to allow more units and for any rezoning, they require years of consultation and approvals. 65% of Victoria is zoned for single family homes, and it's way higher for Oak Bay and Saanich. There is no housing growth without these being upzoned and allowing walkups, townhouses, etc. Demand is steadily increasing while supply stays the same. 

If you are upset about the lack of housing being built/allowed to be built, please email letters to mayor and council in all municipalities that are lacking on housing. They do read these emails and this is currently the best way to affect change by letting them know the number of people upset with the policies. I have linked all of the emails below.

I'm hoping to find people who are:
-pretty decent players, with show experience (maybe a little trained? Able to learn and play these tracks without too much struggle?)
-good people, laid back, cool with vulnerability, friends
-maybe queer? I want to figure out how to be in a band and integrate that into queer spaces and scenes. I doubt I'll find an all-queer band, but I want to at least have the goal of not getting shunted into the totally hetero man scene.

This would be my first time playing my solo stuff live, so there would be some figuring it out...

VictoriaBC,Affectionate-Chips,"On Thursday Victoria City Council will consider a 40 bed permanent supportive housing facility in Vic West at 225 Russell Street; if you care about housing and homelessness in the city please consider writing an email to council in support of this project BC Housing and the Our Place Society are currently running a 50 bed emergency shelter at this site similar to the hotels that they started running over covid, the plan is to convert this former warehouse site in a mixed light-industrial / residential area into 40 ""self-contained permanent supportive residential homes""  with 24/7 on site staff. Each unit would have its own bathroom and kitchen, and most crucially just be a private space with a lock on the door, which is what a lot of people really need to actually get back on their feet. 

&#x200B;

Currently a lot of the emails council has received on this have been from neighbours basically saying ""put it somewhere else"" or truly just ""not in my backyard"". I understand that most people would not be crazy  about a supportive housing facility being built next door to them, but I think we can all recognize that as a society we need these things and if we killed every project because a neighbour objected then we'd get nothing built in the end. We know that concentrating all the social housing and social services in the city in one neighbourhood leads to bad outcomes, it concentrates poverty, makes most people just avoid that area, and leads to exactly what we have in some parts of downtown and Harris Green currently. If you had a drug addiction you were trying to recover from or mental health issues that were seriously affecting your life you probably wouldn't do too well if the only supportive housing you were offered was right on the 900 block of Pandora, we have to give people the opportunity to get out of that environment, and housing facilities like this do exactly that.

&#x200B;

So please, sit down after work today for five minutes and type out an email to council. You can send your letter to [mayorandcouncil@victoria.ca](mailto:mayorandcouncil@victoria.ca) and it will be forwarded to all councillors and the mayor, as well as being published permanently in the agenda for Thursday's meeting with your email redacted (though nothing else is).

* Start with saying you want them to support the project

&#x200B;

So please, if you've ever complained on here about homelessness in the city, about the housing crisis, or about ""the state of downtown!"" actually write in to council on this project, because I guarantee it will do more than just talking about the issues here.

""Island Health’s ban on edible cannabis products is arbitrary and unconstitutional, says the lawyer representing several marijuana dispensaries on Vancouver Island.

Related
Island Health orders pot shops to stop selling edible cannabis products
Kirk Tousaw, who has represented several clients in marijuana access cases, wrote a letter objecting to the ban, addressed to Dr. Richard Stanwick, Island Health’s chief medical health officer.

“The patients that access edibles from dispensaries need that access for their health and quality of life,” Tousaw wrote.

“Dispensaries need to trust that Island Health is committed to working progressively toward appropriate and fact-based access to cannabis edibles, not to be threatened with possible business licensing sanctions by Island Health.”

In March, Island Health sent a letter to dispensaries ordering them to stop selling cannabis edibles because they violate the B.C. Food Premises Regulation, which requires all ingredients to be obtained from a source approved by the federal government.

Tousaw said the use of edibles has been federally approved under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes regulation.

Two recent court cases have enshrined people’s right to access cannabis derivatives and products other than dried cannabis.

Owen Smith, former head baker for the Victoria Cannabis Buyers Club, was arrested in 2009 and charged with possession of THC for the purpose of trafficking after police found pot cookies and other cannabis-infused foodstuffs on the premises.

Tousaw, who represented Smith, fought the charges all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, which ruled in 2015 that restricting patient access to only dried cannabis is arbitrary and unconstitutional.

Stanwick could not be reached for comment, but told the Times Colonist after news of the ban that dispensaries are not receiving their edibles products from federally approved sources. Medical marijuana producers licensed by Health Canada, such as Tilray in Nanaimo, send their products directly to patients through the mail.

“The difficulty is that we do have a producer of marijuana, in fact a number of them, that the federal government [has] sanctioned,” Stanwick said.

“But that is only for people who receive their medical marijuana prescriptions from them. And they are not allowed to sell their product to these bakeries and to these dispensaries for use in edibles.”

Since dispensaries and bakeries are using a non-approved ingredient in food products, the product is considered to be high risk, he said.

Island Health sent a letter to dispensaries on March 29 reinforcing the ban. The health authority said it is working with the City of Victoria, and that any dispensaries that continue to sell edibles could see their request for a business licence rejected.

In his letter, Tousaw said this is an “implicit threat to interfere and harm the business licensing prospects of dispensaries that continue to service their patients by providing access to cannabis edibles.” He said such action might cause damages to dispensaries and their patients “for which Island Health could be found liable.”

Tousaw wrote that Island’s Health approach to edibles has been “fear, regression and a refusal to grow. Fear because despite cannabis edibles being available in Victoria in dispensaries for 20 years, there is essentially no evidence of any harm being caused to any individual as a result.”

Brandon Wright, general manager of Baked Edibles, which supplies marijuana-infused cookies, spreads and other products to dispensaries, said he hopes the letter will “give [Island Health] pause before taking action that is clearly unconstitutional and clearly harmful to the community.”

Wright said none of the dispensaries he supplies have reduced their orders for cannabis edibles in light of the ban.

“We haven’t see a push back yet. There’s been a lot of strength in the community because they know they’re on the side of what’s legally and morally right.”

Tousaw said his clients want to work with Island Health to satisfy any legitimate health concerns without interrupting patient access to edible products.

Unlike the City of Vancouver, which has banned edible marijuana products, the City of Victoria does not specifically mention edibles in its regulations for marijuana businesses.

The federal task force on marijuana legalization has recommended edibles be allowed as long as they are not marketed toward children. The task force also urged a ban on products that mix marijuana with alcohol or caffeine.""

VictoriaBC,AlexRogansBeta,"Downtown burgers, according to a blind taste test amongst my friends Behold, these are the results of a blind taste test of burgers purchased from four, core downtown (+Cook Street) burger places: Bin 4, Pink Bike, Fatburger, and Big Wheel. There was some debate amongst us regarding the superior burger joint. So, we used the following methodology to figure it out.

We ordered one, 'standard cheeseburger' from each of the above locations. We did our best to time the orders to be ready 8 min apart so that we could drive around to each of them, pick them up, and have them as fresh as possible. However, with one vehicle it DID mean that we had to pick up the orders one at a time. As a result, the freshness factor was the following: Fatburger was picked up first, then Pink Bike, then Big Wheel, then Bin 4. Meaning, Fatburger was the least fresh when we got around to eating them, and the rest followed respectively. 

Once we had all the orders we went back to our house with them. Burgers were cut into quarters and arranged on four plates such that each plate had one quarter of each of the four burgers. The burger-quarters were numbered 1 through 4, but each plate's numbering was distinct. Such that on one plate the #1 burger may have been Bin 4, but on another plate it may have been Fatburger. 

Eaters were, one at a time, blindfolded and guided to each of the burger quarters starting with their plate's number one. One at a time the eaters tasted the burgers, and after a few rounds of biting and tasting they declared their preferences. 

Once all eaters had gone through this process, a point system was applied to burger rankings. A #1 preferred burger got 100 points. A #2 got 90. #3 got 80, and #4 got 70. We tallied all the rankings together and divided by four to get the following results. 

Bin 4: 95
Big Wheel: 92.5
Pink Bike: 80
Fatburger: 72.5

As you can see, preference for top burger was nearly identical between Bin 4 and Big Wheel, with Bin 4 having a super tiny edge over Big Wheel. Pink Bike was a clear third, with an average 3rd place ranking. Fatburger was a flop, getting clear last place. 

In our post analysis, we noted that the order in which we picked up the burgers was the exact flip of the results. Bin 4 was the last picked up, and came in first place, then Big Wheel was picked up second last and came in second, and so on. It is unclear how much freshness affected the rankings, or if this was just coincidence. Further testing will be required. 

Tl;dr Bin 4 has the best burger downtown, then Big Wheel, then Pink Bike, and then Fatburger... kinda. ","Our Place, Point in Time",0,False,4.761904761904762

VictoriaBC,AlexRogansBeta,"The Best Korean Fried Chicken in Victoria According to Science There are many, strong opinions about the Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) places in Victoria. A reddit post routinely comes up with endless comments on which is everyone's favourite. We at the **Victorian Society for the Scientific Study of Food** (VSSSF) decided it was time to put KFC to the test. This is our report.

METHODS

*Chicken:* We conducted a **Double Blind Taste Test**. Locations selected for testing were the following: **Chimac**, **Thunderbird**, **Chicken 649**, **Seoul Chicken**, and **Pelicana**. Please note, we aimed to include **Chi-Q Bistro** in our study, but it was inexplicably *closed* on the day of the study. From each location we ordered the **original style chicken**, however that was named at each location. After all, the purpose of this study was not to determine which location has the best sauces, but which has the best fried chicken.

*Participants*: We had 10 participants. I do not believe it would have had much of a bearing on the results, but for the sake of thorough science, here are some quick demographic details. 5 of the participants identified as women and 5 as male. There was a mix of ethnicities and nationalities present. Age range was roughly 25 to 35 range.

*Steps*:

1. An individual was selected to pick up an order of chicken from each location at 4:45 (4:30 for the Langford location). These chickens were delivered to a central location in Saanich. This strict timing was to ensure that none of the chicken spent too much time cooling and sweating inside cardboard delivery containers.
2. A Sharpie was used to draw five numbered segments on paper plates. Within each segment a randomized piece of chicken from each location was places. The result being that everyone had a plate with numbers 1 thru 5, and on each number was a piece of chicken from each location. However, since the distribution between each plate was randomized Person A's chicken #1 did not necessarily correspond with Person B's chicken #1. Each plate had a corresponding key which recorded which chicken was in which plate location for each plate.
3. Individuals then ate their chicken and recorded which chicken was their first, second, third, fourth, and fifth favourite. These were ranked with point values, 1-5, respectively.
4. Once everyone had recorded their results, we cross-referenced individual results with their plate's respective key to determine which chicken had been awarded which point value.
5. The results were organized into a table, and sum totals for each location were calculated. By this ranking method, the KFC with the lowest cumulative point value is the best, and the KFC with the highest point value is the worst.

The worst is **Chimac**. **Pelicana** and **Chicken 649** tied for 2nd place, though the disparity between 1st and 2nd place was very low, with only a two point spread. In effect, it seems that **Pelicana**, **Chicken 649**, and **Seoul Chicken** were all quite favoured. **Thunderbird** came in 4th, and **Chimac** was decidedly ranked in last place.

If you pay attention to the individual ranking results, **Chimac's** last place position becomes quite clear. It was ranked in last place 7 out of 10 times.

Again, paying attention to the individual rankings, **Pelicana's** results are quite interesting. It did not end up with the best cumulative ranking, but it was ranked 1st place 4 out of 10 times, which was the most times a location was given a 1st place ranking. Comparatively, the 1st place chicken, **Seoul Chicken**, was only given two 1st place rankings, but it was awarded four 2nd place rankings and zer 5th place rankings.

One interesting point to make is that **Seoul Chicken** appears to be *owned or closely affiliated* with **Thunderbird**. This is not made obvious on their respective websites, but the website URL [www.thunderbirdkfc.com](https://www.thunderbirdkfc.com) redirects to [www.seoulchicken.ca](https://www.seoulchicken.ca). Additionally, the payment made to **Seoul Chicken** registers under **Thunderbird**. Which makes our findings quite interesting. I am not sure if **Thunderbird** and **Seoul Chicken** are so closely affiliated that they use similar distributors or even use the same recipe. Our results suggest that if **Thunderbird** can replicate what its sister location is doing, then **Thunderbird** would be improved. Or, if they are already using the same ingredients and recipe, then we suggest that **Thunderbird** look into staff training or aging/failing equipment to understand the disparity identified in these results.

VictoriaBC,AllDeckedOut,"At odds with Esquimalt Council going on 4 years now. Should a bylaw supersede the community that wishes to change it? **Please see edits and updates appended below**

I have been dealing with a pretty mundane issue: I expanded my second story sundeck (about 6 feet) and built stairs off of it into my back yard. Previously it was only a deck without stairs, meaning getting into the backyard entailed going out the front door, down the driveway, and through the rear gate; getting better access was good as it was creating a second fire escape (I had one newborn and another on the way), made it easier for us and our dog (the back is fenced), and just made sense at the time.  

  
&nbsp;
  
  
Unfortunately, I was living on a property type called a Comprehensive Development ('CD') zone (there are about 90 of them in Esquimalt). My house is on a once-very-large lot that was subdivided to make way for another house. Basically, the developer at the time asked Esquimalt Council to do this so he could double up on profits (I am assuming, looking at the history/talking to neighbours). Back then CD-zones were called 'spot zones', as the Council would draft up all the zone/property particulars based on what they 'felt' was right at the time. Furthermore, a strata was created and a covenant put on the title (kind of like bargaining chips to Council, I suppose). In any case, there is no strata council here, no fees, no meetings, etc... just the 'common ground', a small triangle at the top of my shared driveway. I know... odd, right?  

  
  
&nbsp;
 
  
Anyhow, these CD zones do not follow the standard residential zones, and in my case, the setbacks (buffer zone between structures on the property and the property line) were brought right up to the house and the lot coverage was locked in at 22 percent (which is usually around 30 percent for most residential zones). In Council's eyes this would prevent all future 'building-out', etc.  
  
  

&nbsp;
  
  
  
Me, being young, first-time home-buyer and pretty illiterate then when it came to 'the system', (although it isn't a good excuse) I went ahead and told the builders to construct the deck extension and stairs safely since my family would be using it, and then be done with it, not knowing I needed permission much less ask for a variance to my zoning.   
  
    
&nbsp;
  

  
In any case everything was built and looked exactly like the current style of the deck. We did all new vinyl, railings, poured lots of concrete, and even braced it with a tonne of rebar. Needless to say it came out looking great and safe, after all it has been around for about 4 years now (this comment was actually made by Barb (mayor) at one of the Council's when she voted in favor of the deck, before she flopped back to wanting it gone of course).  

  
  &nbsp;
  
Unfortunately when my wife and I were listing our home for sale around the end of 2012, according to a letter from Esquimalt, they saw the listing (and the deck) and deemed that it had gone over the 22 percent (to 23 percent) lot coverage allowance and the rear setback allowance conjured up in the bylaws for CD zone. This wasn't an permitting issue, which I assumed it was at first, it was an 'allowance' issue which basically deemed the zone had no more potential for building.         
   
  &nbsp;
  
My first and natural instinct was to apologize and see if there was some amicable way through this  (a fee, lashes, anything)... finding a bit in Esquimalt bylaw codes about 'Building without the benefit of a permit' led me to think that, according to the bylaw, one could pay double the permitting fee and then carry on with their life (once everything had been approved/built to code). Unfortunately, since this was a central-planning-type issue I wasn't even at that step, nor have ever even made it there.  
  
  &nbsp;  
  

I have been ticketed, threatened with more tickets, misled/misinformed, and drained. Council upholds the notion that CD zones should not be changed going forward, partly because they have been too lax in allowing variances to them in the past. This has been their position then and it still is now, putting me into a tough situation: Spend a few thousand and remove the deck/stairs, or... be ticketed until I roll over, or dispute the tickets (court), or go to jail if the tickets pile up (yep, it's been pointed out), or (as we have considered) moving out of Esquimalt, which I'd like to avoid as a nearly 20 year-long resident!
    
  
  &nbsp;
  
  

I'm trying not to ramble (apologies), because most of everything is laid out in the website below over a big timeline with documents, emails, etc. Nevertheless, during this time, ex-Councillors, lawyers, and even the previous Mayor of Esquimalt jumped in to help me out in some way or another. Despite that, _all_ my adjacent neighbours petitioned (yearly) for each of my Council visits _and_ then formed a delegation (with some extra Esquimalt friends) and went to Council to request  that Esquimalt Council change their decision.  

  &nbsp;
  
  

**Nope.**  
  
&nbsp;
  
  
People of Victoria/Esquimalt/Anywhere, what would you do in this case?  I would like to get on with my life, but it seems so pointless to ruin a functional object that cost thousands to build and nobody has an issue with, except for those observing stuff written down somewhere.

I will attempt to get some better photos of the deck in the meantime for everyone just so you don't have to dig too hard in the timeline.

Sorry if this has already been asked, can't seem to hunt down the relevant info. Just curious if anyone knows where I could go to find more info about employer work area/equipment requirements in BC (of if it's all covered at a fed level).

My job requires a PC and we moved to full wfh pretty quick during covid. This was fine, most of us were already wfh a day per week or so. Since the first covid lockdown we now need to work on our personal workstations 8hrs a day, 40 hrs a week. My work has made a point of refusing to send gear (headsets, kbs, mice) or office chairs or anything else we expect to be at our workstations at work. We're allowed to pick them up or pay for them to ship our stuff to us but are also required to pay to return it. IT has repeatedly made a big point about how lending us laptops to connect to work through is a 'gift' because they are 'so generous'.  ​

I read carefully through my employment contract and while everything on the list of duties and responsibilities almost certainly requires a PC, there is no line item that says I have to provide my own equipment at my own cost.

My question is: if my personal PC were to die (and it might any day) and they refuse to lend me a laptop, would I be within my rights to collect my full pay by sitting at my desk for 8 hours being available and willing to take on duties that don't require a PC /phone(there would be none)? 

I don't plan to do this, I'm just really tired of their smug replies to every (from my perspective) reasonable request and was trying to find and educate myself employment law regarding the obligations of employers to provide the space and materials to complete the duties and responsibilities in an employment contract. 

The company has been comically greedy and made an effort to claw back every possible perk during covid despite our business being unaffected by covid. We actually made more money in 2020 then in 2019. The COO has made offhand comments many times regarding us making up internet or power outage time that occurs during work hours, something that to me seems like clear business costs and not something they can push to the employees.

VictoriaBC,AngelusYukito,"Rental issues with upstairs tenants who are also landlords Wasn't sure were else to ask this but I figured this was good place to start.

I've been living in a basement apartment for a year and a half now and am currently on a lease until next Aug. I wanted to switch to month to month after the first year so I could move in May but was pressured into another year lease. 

Essentially the issue is that the landlords (actually the landlords' son I think? It's never been made clear) live above us and there is no sound proofing in the floor/ceiling of the computer room. This room was my previous roommates room and he was very non-confrontational but often alluding to hearing everything. Since changing roommates we turned that room into the computer room and I can confirm there might as well be nothing but a sheet between us and their TV. We can hear every conversation they have and know every show they watch. An unfortunate quirk of the place but not unlivable. Early on I offered that the landlord could text me if we were being too loud and we would do the same.

Unfortunately, there is no mutual respect. I refuse to be silent in my own home and they clearly have no such plans either but that's fine by me. I would get a text occasionally and try and quiet down but often the moment my roommate or I spoke they would turn the TV volume way up to drown us out. This only makes things worse however as we have to be louder in order to hear anything. Even wearing headphones they will turn it up so much I can't hear anything. When they finally pushed me too far I sent a polite text asking them to turn the volume down a little but was responded too being told we were being too loud. This just leads to an arms race. I can't hear over them and have so far resisted plugging in my speakers (which I haven't been able to use since I moved in) to return the favor. 

Every issue I raise with them gets turned on me. We have an ill-fitting door and it creates a terrible draft in the winter and allows every creepy crawly in during the summer but he hasn't found a free door (his words) yet so it can't be replaced. I asked him to dump out and cover the many containers of dirty stagnant water on the property but he's too tired from work. Even when I turned all the buckets of trash on their side he just righted them uncovered. This is just an example of his unwillingness to compromise even when I am very understanding of work and money making property management difficult.   

I'm reaching the end of my rope and am looking for some advice. I've tried to bring it up with them but they are so convinced they are being reasonable they refuse to give any credibility to my claims. I think the landlord-tenant tribunal (or whatever the bc equivalent is, I'm from ON originally) is a bit much but they've started stomping on the ceiling in what I can only assume is a warning and immediately are knocking on my door if we make any loud noises. We were tenderizing meat for dinner the other day and the landlord was knocking and demanding to know what the sound was within a minute. Any advice would be appreciated. I'm not shy of conflict I just don't think they are bad people, just ignorant of their part in this and clearly would prefer not to rent if their income allowed it.

VictoriaBC,Anon1101111,"ATTN VICTORIA RENTERS My landlord called me recently with a sob story about how her costs have gone up and how she’s been so great to me so far. Since her place would now be worth so much more on the open market vs the rent we are currently paying, she is now requiring a 38% increase for us to continue staying there. She tried being slimy and with the new paper work and sneaking it in for January (2 months notice instead of the 3 I’m entitled to), hoping I wouldn’t read it and just sign away. 

Renters: Please, please, please be wary of landleeches using these slimy tactics to extract more money from you than they are entitled to BY LAW (it’s 2% this year, not a penny more). Please familiarize yourself with the Residential Tenancy Act, it’s actually quite short and written in plain language and is a collection the rights you are entitled to by law as a tenant in BC. My landlord I’m sure is very familiar with it and is banking on me having not read it. 

If they try to evict you, please contact the RTB (residential tenancy branch) immediately, this is essential. They are on the renter’s side and will help you fight unlawful eviction from your suite that you’re holding up your end of the agreement for. 

If you sign for these insane rent increases, you are contributing to the skyrocketing rents in this city, screwing yourself and every other renter over in the future. I’m digging my heels in and taking a stand, and not letting her blackmail me with keeping a roof over my head.

VictoriaBC,Arbiter448,"Very important Victoria mini-golf tier list Me and my two friends hit every mini golf course we could find around Victoria over the weekend, and I thought I'd share our aggregate thoughts. While potentially not comprehensive: we did Blenkinsop Adventure mini-golf, Haunted mini-golf, Mattick's Farm mini-golf, and Island View mini-golf Course. In order of our rankings. . .

Blenkinsop: A.

Most fun course altogether (with some suspect turf leveling) and had fine quality balls and putters. Even won a free game on the ball collect hole, which was a gimmick that was sorely lacking from every other venue. Aesthetically trying to be fantasy and castle themed, but it comes off kind of adorably degraded like an unupdated bowling alley. Our favourite and probably the one I'd go back to again because it doesn't require driving halfway to Sidney.

Island View Golf Course: B.

The course itself is great and the landscaping makes me feel like I'm walking around a wedding reception venue. Best kept turf but could've maybe used less holes that weren't 'get in one hole that takes you to another patch of turf.' Crippled by the cursed bendy putters that absolutely fried our muscle memory and aging 20+ year old fine motor controls. If it had regular putters, it'd be the best one on the island.

Haunted Mini Golf: C.

Contender for worst but had some fun stuff. Really tight space packed with holes and 'gimmick' holes. Tilt a dinner table and get to the other side like it's Super Monkey Ball. A pachinko board that either gives you a hole-in-one or starts you far away from a really easy hole. Kind of neat but the haunted conceit just meant you're being blasted by every Spirit Halloween noise maker prop at once (extremely rough for people who experience sensory overload). Also the most expensive: entry costs the same as a burger and fries downtown. Oof/10

Mattick's Farm Mini-Golf: F

A cry for help. Worst kept turf, worst putters, worst balls somehow (pock marks are eroded away), and nothing happening in the course. The course had these weird metalwork obstacles(?) where the optimal way to interact with them is just putting around them. I couldn't stop thinking of the ['statch' hole from an ancient Strong Bad email] (https://youtu.be/w1RqpEjeYU0?t=146), so unlocking that memory is a bit good? But also there are large painted cement mushrooms and dragons, so at one point I can only assume the course was a fantasy themed golf course before the owner's son had nowhere to put his welding projects? Cheapest but Blenkinsop or Island View is like two-four dollars more for a better mini-golfing experience.

In discussing where drug use activity takes place in Victoria, there was widespread agreement among stakeholders that there is not one concentrated area, but rather that there are pockets of drug use dispersed throughout the city. As a political representative noted, “one reason people may come here from Vancouver is because they find it unsafe there, they’re scared because of the concentration [in Vancouver], but in Victoria, we’re all over the place” (SCS13). When asked to identify specific locations where drug-related activities take place, stakeholders most commonly mentioned areas where services for drug users are located, especially near the following organizations: AIDS Vancouver Island (Blanshard St. & Cormorant St.), Streetlink (Swift St. & Store St.), Mustard Seed (Government St. & Queens Ave.), St. John the Divine (Quadra St. & Mason St.), and Sandy Merriman (Quadra St. & Burdett Ave.). As a drug user informant noted, “downtown, people inject in the underground [parkades], outside of Streetlink, outside the door here [AVI], they go up to the church too [St. John the Divine]…the cops basically give us those four areas where they aren’t going to bust you as long as you are gone by 7am” (FG05). Other areas that were commonly identified are areas where sex trade activities occur, especially Rock Bay and the southwest corner of Beacon Hill Park. However, a few stakeholders stressed that the sex trade tends to move around in Victoria. A number of stakeholders stated that the intersection of Douglas St. and Yates St. is one of the main areas for drug use, purchase, and distribution. A business owner believed that **“Yates St. is the main street for drug use…it’s the worst in the city, everyone knows that drugs are available there and drug use in front of the public is very common”** (SCS43). Some stakeholders mentioned that areas along Store St., especially near Value Village and Capital Iron, are common locations for drug use activity. Some of the other locations that were mentioned include: Douglas St. & Pandora St.; Commercial Alley (also known as heroin alley); both ends of the Johnson St. Bridge; Whale Wall; certain sections along the Galloping Goose Trail; and Bastion Square. Everyone agreed that many areas feel the effects of drug use: “shooting up is everywhere, on the grounds of Government House, Centennial Square, every neighbourhood is impacted” (SCS10). Most stakeholders agreed that the drug problem is widespread and that it is not limited to downtown Victoria. As a social service provider noted, “the drug scene is often what people see in the downtown core but it’s so much more than that… it’s not just the small percentage of people who are seen daily on the street, it’s a much larger issue” (SCS01). Some stakeholders explained that as residents and businesses complain about the visibility of drug use downtown, drug users are displaced to areas just outside the downtown core: “cops get on the bandwagon and it gets pushed out to North Park and Fernwood” (SCS21). Similarly, a social service provider thought that **some drug users are “moving out to Oak Bay because there is less hassling there”**

Some stakeholders mentioned that 
neighbourhoods in transition and low-cost rental housing complexes are areas where 
drug-related activities take place. **However, many stakeholders stressed that drug use is 
prevalent in many other areas of Victoria, even in communities commonly thought of as 
wealthy or immune to such social problems.** As a political representative noted, “people in 
wealthy communities also use drugs, but we don’t see this happening, we don’t realize 
they’re addicts because they manage to function every day and they manage to fund their 
addictions…when they shoot up, they’re shooting up in their homes”

VictoriaBC,BCTOfficialOperator,"BC Transit Will Not Be Shutting Down*! Good day everybody,

I've seen a few posts recently asking when/if BC Transit will be shutting down.

We will not be shutting down, *unless a large majority, or all of of operators becoming incapacitated, which, hopefully, will never happen.

It has been pointed out a few times in the past days that BC Transit is not legally defined as an essential service, but, in reality, we are, especially in times such as these, people still need to be able to move throughout the city, and many people rely on us as their sole mode of transportation, and we take that seriously.

In the coming days/weeks you will see changes to the service.  Today we implemented rear door loading, and free fares, this is a protective measure for operators in the hopes of keeping us healthy longer, the linger we're healthy, the longer we keep everybody moving.  Due to how BC Transit works, a disease as heavily contagious as this one would spread rapidly through our workforce, so it is a necessity that we take every action available to keep operators healthy.  

You will see a reduction in service, due to operator shortages (not entirely due to this current pandemic), runs may be missed, or cancelled, please check the website and the NextRide program for the most up to date information on cancelled runs.

We will be prioritizing runs that service hospitals, and other essential services.

I hope, going forward, you will have patience and understanding with us as we try to keep this city moving, and you will take actions to protect yourself, and the people around you.

If you must ride the bus, try to wash your hands as frequently as possible, load and disembark through the rear doors (if you need to load through the front doors due to mobility issues you will absolutely be accommodated), cover your mouth and nose with your elbow when coughing/sneezing, don't touch your face, and, as best you can in the confined space of the bus practice social distancing!

VictoriaBC,BRNYOP,"Adult ADHD or other mental health diagnosis? I am wondering if anyone in Victoria can let me know what steps I need to take to receive some sort of assessment/diagnosis for mental health problems that are severely impairing my life.

I am quite desperate for help at this point. I have been dealing with my problems under the assumption that they were all caused by depression - which they might be - but lately I have read a few things that have given me the notion that I might be dealing with ADHD or something like that. The problem is, I have such a long history with walk-in clinics and basically doing what would look to an outside party as ""dabbling"" in medication to try to fix things, that I fear that it will seem as if I am just chasing a new medication to try to ""fix"" me. I'm a woman in her 30s and I worry that doctors think I am over-reacting to normal shifts in mood. The reality is that I have been on and off depression medications so many times with so little success, and I am really scared because everything just gets worse. There has been no reprieve, this year. I have no direction in life... I work an ok job but I am too scared to go to school because of my issues with distraction, intrusive thoughts, and lack of focus. I am a very motivated person, in general, but nowadays most of the time I feel that I can't even think straight enough to know what steps to take. I have been to a counsellor but I honestly feel that I am taking good care of myself mentally, I am conscious of my thought processes and have good coping strategies, but even with all of that I can't manage like this.

VictoriaBC,Bagration,"Shipyard noise question. Hey Victoria!
I am looking for guidance.  
Just over a year ago I moved to Esquimalt, just north of the base and shipyard. On a few occasions since, i have been bothered by noise from shipyard at night.  
Now, I am fairly tolerant, and I kind of knew what i was getting into when i moved next to a military base and shipyard.... I was in the navy at the time too so I fully understood that there would be bong bongs in mornings, construction noise during the day and ocassional alarms at night.  
What i did not expect is construction noise at night and in the early morning on the weekends. I feel like i have reached my threshhold with the cruiseship that pulled into dry-dock last night. Since it arrived, it has not stopped running some machinery which makes a rumbling noise every 3min 20sec (timed it) that feels like a dump truck driving in our backyard. It is more of a vibration throughout the house than a sound. All night! In addition to this, they started hammering metal around 0730 this morning...on a sunday.

So my questions:  
1. Is the shipyard exempt from regular Esquimalt nuisance (noise) bylaws? I could not find the shipyard mentioned anywhere in there. If it is not, it should not make excessive noise 2200-0700 on weekdays and 2200-0900 on weekends.  
2. If they are not exempt from bylaws, and they are causing unreasonable noise at night, what is the proper way to report this?  
  
I cannot be the only one that has a problem with this. Seems like the shipyard is pushing boundaries trying to provide fast service times at the expense of the peace and quiet of their neighbors (again, I am talking about quiet hours).  Any input is appreciated!",Service provider ,0,False,45.0

Seeing as I would never fly it above 400', over people, or in the vicinity of other aircraft, I believe I would be within this definition.

VictoriaBC,BearWithFish,"Why is BC Ferries CEO Mark Collins not being held accountable for his failures while taking more than $500,000.00 salary? BC Ferries continues to cancel sailings. They continue to blame staff shortages yet announce they have hired 500 new employees and are hiring back unvaccinated employees.

Am I alone in thinking this is a failure in leadership? The CEO makes a $500-600,000 annual salary (link below). Are we not paying for a business leader enough to forecast demands and operate an essential business smoothly? I have a hard time understanding where the accountability lies and why there has been questioning of why we are in a staff shortage. Are we just to accept that its because of Covid recovery? I think that is ludicrous. The ferries continued to sail, albeit with certain amenities shut (pacific buffet, SeaWest Lounge) but from my recollection there was no reduction in service?

Also, the hiring of 500 new employees seemed reactionary to the problem rather than planning ahead for (another) busy summer season and a busier travel industry with more international visitors.

Tillicum Rd southbound, approaching Craigflower, used to consist of two lanes, each a dual turn/thru lane (one left-turn or straight, the other right-turn or straight).  Traffic was heavy and got backed up to the point that you may have to sit through the light 3-4 times on a heavy traffic day.

Now the only thru lane is the right lane (which is also the only right-turn lane), with the left lane now a dedicated left-turn-only.

With the vast majority of traffic going straight through the intersection, the result is that the right lane backs up so far that no one wanting to turn left can access the dedicated left-turn lane, which in turn backs up traffic even further down the now single-lane Tillicum Rd.  The left lane sits largely unused on each cycle of the light, with maybe 5 or 6 cars making it through the light, while the right lane backs up (literally) all the way to Gorge Rd.

We are in our 30s and will be starting a family hopefully. I want to hear the perspectives of people who have spent considerable time (years?) in each city. I know cost of living varies between the cities, but am hoping to ignore that issue given that we are doing well financially and for all intents and purposes we can afford what we want in either place. I know job markets may differ as well, but we are self-employed so that is not a concern in our lines of work.

My wife and I are primarily interested in the variables below. They are not in any particular order and I am interested in differences you might be aware of between the cities on these issues. Some I know are quite obvious (e.g., weather)! Of course any general opinions are also very welcome! 
 
- Weather
- Access to outdoor activities
- Quality of schools and universities
- Extracurricular activities for children
- Quality of healthcare
- The “fun” or “hip” factor of the city. This might be the “buzz” of the downtown feel. This might be theatres, music, etc.
- Shopping
- Restaurants
- Traffic
- Ease of travel by plane
- Safety
- Friendliness of people and community

My mom, on the Island, now has it and has just recently discovered all of this film and would love to return it to the original owner, or next-of-kin given how old some of the dates are.

There are a lot of details on each package, and I’ve uploaded several pictures of the items: [https://imgur.com/a/nnUdG32](https://imgur.com/a/nnUdG32)

There are names, addresses and phone numbers printed...but given the timeframe we haven’t been able to find much online. Turning to Reddit to see if anybody recognizes a name, or some the details. The information on the film packages includes:

**Names**:

* Mr and Mrs Frank Thompson

**Addresses & Dates (by whats written on packages)**:

* 6290 Springlea Rd, Victoria (1967-1970ish)
* \#214-443 Superior St, Victoria (1973-1980)
* Enderby (1981)

**Phone Numbers**:

* 384-5325
* 478-2249 (Superior Rd address)

There was one package with the developer address listed: “Island Colour Labs, 615 Fort Street” but it doesn’t appear to exist anymore.

Outside of visiting the two civic addresses, and seeing if the owners know the selling history and have contact information I’m not too sure what else can be done.

***UPDATE #1 - May 11, 2020 @ 7:15pm:*** I really can't believe how fast this happened, but after posting to the recommended Old Victoria group on Facebook, the post has been shared 47 times and commented over a dozen times. Within a couple hours of posting, one member (an archivist/researcher) found the death records for the two owners:

We confirmed these were them, and the group member also discovered the couple had 5 children - some of which names appear on the found film. She was able to find a member of the family via the Ancestry family tree and sent a message. We have since heard back from that family member and were provided a phone number and address for one of the children in Vernon, BC...as well as a name of another child currently living in Victoria. I will be reaching out to the children and will keep this thread updated. Looks like we have solved this story within a few hours. Crazy!

&#x200B;

***UPDATE #2 - May 11, 2020 @ 8:15pm:***  I just chatted on the phone with two of the daughters of the family, one of whom lives 15 mins away from me in Nanaimo. We have arranged to meet up on Wednesday to give them back their long lost family videos. It was incredible to talk to both of the sisters and hear some of their memories coming back about what might be on the family tapes. Thanks to the research done by the member of the Facebook group, it literally took 5 hours from posting this to talking to the family on the phone. Incredible!

VictoriaBC,Bond007Bond007,"Baby Jessica, Adriana Bonner who is the baby found in ditch April 14, 1986 on Triangle Mountain is an inspiration to many. As written by Charla Huber of Victoria Times Colonist. https://www.timescolonist.com/opinion/columnists/charla-huber-i-was-also-adopted-so-baby-jessica-s-story-really-resonated-with-me-1.24198581 


Charla Huber: I was also adopted, so Baby Jessica’s story really resonated with me


I met Times Colonist reporter Louise Dickson when we were both were covering a high-profile murder trial. I was in the third trimester of my pregnancy, and shared with her my fear of my water breaking during the trial. Thankfully, that didn’t ­happen.

After sitting near her in court for many days and getting to know the face behind the byline, I have always been a fan of Dickson and her writing.

Last Sunday, I was immediately drawn to the article about Baby Jessica, who grew up to be Adriana Jessica Bonner, written by Dickson.

As I read the article about a newborn baby abandoned in a gym bag on Triangle Mountain in 1986 born to a 17-year-old girl, I was captivated. There were components of the story that I deeply connected with.

In my column, I’ve written before about being adopted. I am not upset I was adopted, it’s part of what makes me, me.

I was born to a 17-year-old girl, and like Bonner, my birth mother also hid her pregnancy. No one knew she was pregnant until 10 minutes before I was born.

Five years ago, I connected with some biological family members on my birth mother’s side, including my birth mother.


She told me she remembers getting to the hospital and being pushed in a wheelchair by someone who was running to get her into a room quickly. It was the early 1980s, and as soon as I was born, I was whisked out of the room and my birth mother never got to see me, hold me or even say goodbye. She was asked to keep me a secret. Only one family member knew I was born.

I am grateful to the connection I made and conversations I had, but I am still a secret outside of their immediate family. Bonner shared her feelings about being kept a secret by her birth mother, and it’s an experience I deeply connected with.

I don’t think it’s a story told very often, and I am grateful to Bonner and Dickson for making that happen.

I am not upset with my biological family for keeping me a secret. I haven’t walked in their shoes, and I am glad to have had the opportunity to learn where I come from. Even without harbouring ill feelings, it’s a strange place to be.

When I think of my own birth mother and Bonner’s birth mother both being pregnant at 17 and hiding it from everyone, it sounds absolutely terrifying. I can’t imagine what it would be like to hide a pregnancy, and the stress and fear that would go along with that.
In the article, Dickson did an amazing job capturing the emotions that come with entering the world in a traumatic way.
When I read about Bonner connecting with her birth father and reading that the two of them were saddened by all the lost years, it brought me back to when I connected with a sister I never knew I had.
Jennifer was three years younger than me. We would chat online and talk on the phone, and we had a lot of things in common. Our childhood photos side-by-side looked nearly identical. At that time, my sister had Stage 4 breast cancer and was very sick. She flew to Victoria to meet me and my daughter and we spent four days together. It was an emotional time because I knew when I said goodbye to her, I would never see her again.

Jennifer died shortly after our visit.

I hadn’t thought about that chapter in my life for a while, and it was this article that brought it all back.
I am so grateful that Bonner was open to sharing her story and all the raw emotions that come with it. It’s important that we hear these stories. I appreciate the courage it takes to share such a story, and it helps others know they are not alone in their experience.
It’s a fascinating story, and I am sure many readers recall Baby Jessica being found in 1986, and were pleased to hear an update.

If we take something away from Bonner’s story, it’s to find ways to support teens who are in these situations and let teens know that they can ask for support without judgment. Choices we make when we are young can haunt us our entire lives, and they affect all parties involved.

Perhaps you've heard of him?  Or one of his alias Chiavardi/Chavas/Chevas

10+ stories of allegations of rape, sexual assault, drugging and over serving of alcohol, against Jesse, a bartender at Chucks burger bar, Victoria BC. He entices women with drinks, tries to ‘befriend’ them and will make advances when the opportunity arises. 

Chucks Burger Bar is aware of the situation and condones his behaviours because he brings in a lot of customers. 

Allegations are he fled Hamilton for the exact same thing and odds are he's fled Victoria, BC by now. People are being encouraged to go to Vic PD with any information about the assaults and behaviours. However, currently Police have notified victims that they are unable to press charges because the stories are “hearsay”. Which is very invalidating for the victims. If you or anyone you know has been assaulted or have witnessed such behaviour, please contact Vic PD’s non emergency at 250-995-7654. 

Feel free to share anything to hopefully prevent this from happening in the next city (20+ years of this behavior, doubt it stops today). Jesse has fled cities and provinces before and he will most likely do it again.

I have CFS/ME and chronic pain as well as fairly severe scoliosis as well as other issues. I’ve spent at least 80 percent of my time in bed for the last year and a half or more and I just can’t do it anymore.

VictoriaBC,BullishGrizzly,"Covid testing Just curious about other peoples experiences. I was feeling pretty rundown (fatigue), headache, sore throat about 4 days ago. I called BC health links to book a Covid test and they said they’d call me within 24 hrs to book an appointment. It’s now been 3 days and no call. I get it’s New Years and they are busy with omicron but it had me thinking how much this virus is spreading before any single person is actually getting tested. I have quarantined but I do have family in the house and they stay home as well, but at some point my wife will need to head out and get groceries for us. I also don’t think everyone is as diligent in staying home when they show symptoms. Im starting to think the fight against Covid is futile and we will all just get this virus in the end.

VictoriaBC,BullishGrizzly,"How do you guys do it? Question for working parents balancing life and young children. I feel burnt out, financially trapped, socially isolated and guilty I can’t be the best version of myself for my wife or my young kids. wondering if I’m the only one who feels this constant pressure?

I know life and people are complex and there’s a myriad of things, thoughts and situations I can’t cover on this topic but I figured I would share my experience as of late, maybe other parents out there feeling the same?

Basically I’m a father of 2 kids both under 5 years old. I’m Married to a loving supportive wife. On the surface we are the perfect family but underneath I struggle every single day.

Stresses from work, bills, quality time with family, house cleaning and upkeep. It’s a lot to balance and there is no break. The newest issue is we can’t find childcare for neither of our kids for my wife to go to work. Bills pile up and we are starting to sink financially as our savings is eroding at a very fast pace until my wife can get back to work and even at that her monthly income will simply pay for childcare and a bit more to cover bills. Even if we do get care the drop off and pickup is all during working hours or hours that were commuting back home. It seems impossible to make this all come together.

I feel like everything I’ve worked for has been just to break even at this point. It’s difficult to be at work and get razzed by the guys for not going out. As if I’m less of a man for being with my kids. I leave early and get home late from a long commute. Rush dinner, cleanup and put kids to bed. Rinse repeat everyday. The house is a mess constantly. My patience is so thin that I snap at the kids so easily and small arguments with my wife pop up from nothing.

I feel like this will be life for the next 15-20 years. 

It makes me hate my work, makes me feel like I’m drowning, so deep that I don’t even want to try at anything anymore.

Don’t get me wrong I’m thankful for my family and I know I’m blessed. My kids aren’t sick with cancer or disabilities. Yet I struggle mentally, because I’m suppose to have it together and I don’t.","Complex care , Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, People with lived experience, Social Housing , Sooke Transition House Society",0,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,BullishGrizzly,"With Bell let’s talk day next week - I’m wondering about Psychedelics and Mental health. Also will share my story. I’m sure many of you heard of the research going on with the link between psychedelics curing or at least helping cope with mental illnesses. I’m not well versed on the topic but is there any psychologists doing this in Victoria or somewhere nearby?

I invite anyone to chat/discuss about their battles or experience with mental health struggles no matter how big or small.

I’ll tell you that since I’ve struggled, I’ve grown much more compassionate towards others who fight in a different way, whether it’s addiction of any sort or suicidal thoughts etc. It’s easy to judge from our point of view and say what one should do…addicted to booze? Just quit! I’ve come to appreciate others who battle mentally. I’ll share my story below but basically i struggle with panic attacks my mind tricks my body into thinking it’s having a heart attack, i know i’m not, but I can’t just switch it off despite numerous doctors and tests telling me I’m healthy. Plus I even eat healthy and exercise. Again, it’s not a switch I can turn off.

Read on for my experience:

I have battled with bouts of mild to medium depression but largely it’s anxiety and severe panic attacks which have landed me in the ER around 30-40 times in the last 15 yrs. All this stemming from post traumatic stress since I was 23 (now 38) to this day I am on low dose antidepressants (to battle my panic attacks, not so much the depression part). My father passed away infront of me from a massive heart attack at 54 years of age and I was the first responder and tried CPR. The sounds, smells,taste, visions and touch all still resonate in my mind and it’s taking me many many therapy sessions with councillors, psychologists and one psychiatrist to help deal with guilt. All these helped for sure, but I can’t say I’m cured after 15 years of self help books and prescriptions, meditation, acupuncture, massage therapy, reflexology, religion, CBD etc. The kicker is in the midst of dealing with the loss of my father and the whole experience of that night, my mind and body have re-enacted its own “heart attack” via panic attacks so many times since his death. I have had so many where I’ve been able to calm myself down but it took a lot of therapy and practice to do and so many that just get away from me where I have to take Ativan. Other times I’ve dialled 911 only to call them back and cancel because I calmed down enough to know it’s another false heart attack. Finally some have been just so aggressive and quick that only an emergency  ER visit and 2mg of Ativan will do.

I’m am now ok with my father’s passing  and even how he must of felt in his final moments, but something fundamentally changed in my brain. Even during cardio workouts I can feel panic coming on from an increase in heart rate sometimes.

It’s hard to balance this side of myself with work and kids. I’ve been in meetings at work or mid conversations with people and have had massive panic attacks, my face faking a polite smile while I try to keep my sentences on point and stay coherent, meanwhile my heart is going 180bpm and I’m scared I’ll faint and die on the floor infront of everyone. Panic attacks or fear of having them have interrupted vacations, it’s kept me from going out, it’s sent me home from get together, it’s made me turn the car around after driving to mt Washington or camping.

I’ll say 95% of my life is fine but that 5% can be so debilitating and scary that it has marbled it’s way into almost everything I do. I’ve tried and stuck with many different treatments and techniques that help me but the road is still long and hence my curiosity with psychedelics. My curiosity lies with this being a direct intent to help along with supervision in therapy, not self medicate.

VictoriaBC,COVIDtoria,"Stuck at home with nothing to do? Consider sewing some masks. **IMPORTANT: Proper social distancing and hand hygiene is still of #1 importance in this pandemic. Stay home as much as possible. Avoid touching your face. If you choose to wear a mask, avoid touching the front of it and observe proper hand hygiene when putting masks on and taking masks off (**[helpful video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OABvzu9e-hw)**). Wash cloth masks after each use in a washing machine; hot water is recommended. MASKS ALONE DO NOT PROVIDE PROTECTION FROM COVID19.**

This post is meant for information purposes and patterns (at bottom). Use your own best judgement. If you choose to make masks and give them to others, it's important to take proper precautions. Recipient(s) should wash any masks they receive before using.

**Current BC CDC stance on mask usage:**

>Masks should be used by sick people to prevent transmission to other people. A mask will help keep a person's droplets in. It may be less effective to wear a mask in the community when a person is not sick themselves. Masks may give a person a false sense of security  and are likely to increase the number of times a person will touch their  own face (e.g., to adjust the mask). ([source](http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/about-covid-19/prevention))

The US is already encountering extreme shortages of medical-grade masks, and some hospitals [are enlisting help](https://fortune.com/2020/03/23/n95-mask-shortage-coronavirus-sewists-seamstresses/) from their communities to sew masks, in accordance with [US CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.html) on using home-made masks as a last resort. Notable efforts include: [rosiesews.org](https://rosiesews.org); [100 million mask challenge](https://www.providence.org/lp/100m-masks)

Medical-grade masks are sold out everywhere and should be reserved for front-line healthcare workers. Home-made masks, used properly and in conjunction with the recommended social distancing and proper hand hygiene, might offer some protection. Consider making masks for friends and family for when they absolutely must go out (e.g. for groceries). Consider making masks for your local grocer or other essential services if they want them.

[Here's an article from The Lancet that discusses the rational use of masks in a pandemic.](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30134-X/fulltext)

**General information:**

* COVID19 is transmitted by respiratory droplets, created by coughing, sneezing, and [breathing](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses)
* Respiratory droplets can range anywhere from 0.6 to 1000 µm in size ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2894888/))
* **Home-made masks can block up to 70-95% of particles 0.95-1.25 µm in size, and 50-86% of particles .02 µm in size, depending on material used (**[**source**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258525804_Testing_the_Efficacy_of_Homemade_Masks_Would_They_Protect_in_an_Influenza_Pandemic)**)**
* One study suggests 80%+ of people in China were infected through 'stealth transmission' -- people who are unaware they are infected or who have mild symptoms ([source](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses))
* The WHO says you can be infectious 24-48 hours prior to showing first symptoms (though they currently believe this is not a driver of the pandemic; [source](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=96b04adf_2))
* Masks are proven to be effective at reducing transmission from infected individuals to healthy individuals (source: hospitals everywhere)
* Some Asian countries heavily advocate for universal mask usage and it has been credited for reducing spread in some places ([example: Hong Kong](https://twitter.com/lwcalex/status/1235091542219448321))
* Making your own masks does not take away the vital supply of medical & N95 masks from health care workers
* Anything is better than nothing, according to a 2008 study by researchers in the Netherlands and US ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/#!po=87.5000)):

>Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and  infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and  imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection.

&#x200B;

**WHAT YOU WILL NEED:**

1. A tight-weave non-stretch 100% cotton material. Pre-shrunk is best, but you can also [shrink it yourself](https://www.wikihow.life/Shrink-Cotton-Fabrics). Tea towels might be the best at filtering according to [this study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258525804_Testing_the_Efficacy_of_Homemade_Masks_Would_They_Protect_in_an_Influenza_Pandemic), but the trade off is they are more difficult to breathe through. The study used cotton t-shirts. Some patterns suggest a heavier outer layer such as denim, duck cloth, canvas, twill.
2. Elastic band or ribbons to go around the ears
3. Some patterns use craft wire, thin metal or plastic-coated wire (twist-ties) to create a moldable nose piece for a better fit. You could also add these to other patterns if you chose to.

VictoriaBC,Calvinshobb,"Vancouver sent home a new Covid school survey today, would you like to see a similar one for Victoria parents and students ? Options for Student Learning in September (Kindergarten to Grade 7):


Option 1 - Returning to full time in-person instruction as per Stage 2 of the Education Restart Plan. All schools will have safety plans for COVID-19 exposure control according to the enhanced safety guidelines under Stage 2 of the BC Return to School Plan. The student’s classroom will be their primary learning environment. Elementary students may also be grouped in learning groups of up to 60 students and staff for recess, lunch, and occasional learning activities.


Option 2 - Home Schooling
The School Act permits parents to provide an educational program for their children at home. Families selecting this option are required to register their child as a Home Schooler by September 30 at the child’s catchment school. If a parent chooses to home school their child they must let the school know their plans. Home School students are able to borrow textbooks from the school. However, Home School students are not entitled to attend part-time classes or participate in any school activities. There are no assignments or assessments from teachers while the parent is the primary educator. As per our usual practice, space will not be held in local school or choice program for in-person instruction.


Option 3 – Vancouver Learning Network Elementary Program
The Vancouver Learning Network (VLN) is a distributed learning program operating within the Vancouver School District. Distributed learning programs are well suited for students who wish to learn at home or need more flexibility in their schooling schedule. If parents wish to follow the provincial curriculum, in a more structured educational program delivery, they should contact the Vancouver Learning Network located in the southeast wing of John Oliver School at (604) 713-5520. As per our usual practice space will not be held in local school or choice program for in-person instruction.


Option 4 – Transition Program (Under Consideration)
The District is exploring offering families who are not ready to have their children return to in- person instruction with a temporary transition option. This option will allow students to learn remotely and to receive some learning support from the District. It is important to note that in this option, support will likely be one-on-one check-in times with an on-line teacher assigned by the District. Children who chose this option will continue to be enrolled in their local school and be placed in a learning group for possible transition to in-person instruction at set dates in the

You've got restaurants closing due to staff shortages,

A local population fed up with excessive top culture (yes, it is absurd, you don't ""tip"" at subway, for takeout, or anything that's not over and above, and yes, I worked in the service industry for years and made a butt load from tips),

And the need for people to make a living wage that's dependable.

Just open a restaurant called Tax&Tips Included. No tipping. Pay staff $30-40/hr, and price the food accordingly.

Once I got off I realized I had left my wallet and another personal artifact onboard, my friend and I then got in his car and managed to catch up to the bus in Victoria.

I got on the bus and asked the driver if anyone had turned it in, he responded in the negative. So I went upstairs to check where I had been sitting and there were people sitting there, I asked them if they had seen it and everyone said no.

I did however see something else I left on the bus, so I think the guy sitting in my spot took it. It would have been very close to the camera they have at the back.

I took note of when the incident occurred and the license plate of the bus, and passed it off to police.

Although offsetting tax increases with reserves has been a longstanding policy, staff said the ­practice under a council led by then-mayor Stew Young was dramatically increased in 2020, 2021 and 2022 — taking $1.4 million, $1.65 million and $1.78 million from general reserve funds to cover operating costs in lieu of property taxes.

In a presentation to committee of the whole on Monday, director of finance Michael ­Dillabaugh said continued use of the policy has “compounding effects” that challenge the reserve’s ­sustainability.

This is not something I'd ever thought I would be posting on the internet to strangers but I'm at my wits end....So 3 months ago I had an extremely scary sudden sickness. I'm still not entirely sure what happened but the best I can gather is I got some sort of infection/ virus in my stomach that decimated my body. It hurt everywhere. I'm pretty sure it it nuked my stomach lining making it almost impossible to eat. I lost 15 pounds in 2 weeks (I'm 6 foot and weigh 175). The worst thing was the crazy heart palpitation's and panic attack like symptoms I would get. Especially after eating. I would also get crazy gas that would build up causing my heart to beat heavy and my insides to hurt. I had inflammation in my entire body. My muscles were all hard to the touch.So I was in and out of the ER about 10 times the first month. Unfortunately the ER is really only equipped to check if your actively dying and if not send you home. They were primarily worried about my heart as per the crazy palpitations which were causing an irregular heart beat during the attacks.My GP is in the process of closing his practice right now and has shown no interest or concern for my health. Fast forward to now and my symptoms have slowly gotten better over the last 3 months but some things are staying the same/ getting slightly worse.  Pretty much I have perpetual chest pain and heart burn when I eat or drink anything. I still get allot of gas build up but it's not nearly as bad as it was. If I eat a normal sized meal I get a throbbing sensation in my stomach and chest. The chronic pain is making it really hard to live a normal life. Pretty much it feels like someone has their hand in my chest and is squeezing.

Does anybody here know a caring doctor that can help me figure out what's going on and how to fix it? I don't need to be a permanent patient I just need help with this one thing.

A few years ago I stupidly thought he needed help so I went over to talk to him. As soon as I was close, he reached over the fence and grabbed my arm TIGHT. I kept asking him to let go of me but he wouldn't, and kept tugging on my arm to the point where I thought my shoulder might pop out.
I was saved by a man driving past in a truck, he must have noticed how scared I looked. He stopped his truck in the middle of the street, got out, and ripped the guy's hand off of me (leaving a huge hand print, his grip was crazy stong) I was pretty stunned by the whole ordeal. Truck guy asked if I was okay and then told me to head out. I didn't even think to thank him, I just scurried away home.
  
I only just remembered this yesterday when I was walking down Simcoe with my friend and the same guy was in his yard yelling ""hey!"" At any passing women. I was instantly terrified and almost started crying.

Bike lanes aren't the cure /s

Garbage in the water and a needle in the sand (that we cleaned up) but to be honest, I'm not feeling comfortable with the city we are becoming. It isn't safe. It's dirty. I wouldn't allow my kids to actually run around Beacon Hill Park or play at the beach due to reality of the dangers in downtown Victoria.

Before someone says 'compared to xyz location"" I hear you, however it is an easy cop out. The population is over 400k and we're turning into every other gross city.

* Businesses that are locally owned seem to be getting squeezed out.
* Prices are just straight up out of control.
* The homeless population is becoming increasingly more hazardous.

""Our Place launches COVID-19 Emergency Plan - Stage 3

Feeding the most vulnerable remains top priority 

VICTORIA, B.C. – In response to the province declaring a public health emergency over COVID-19, Our Place is closing its doors but not its heart in this time of crisis.

To comply with these stricter health guidelines, Our Place is closing down access to its drop-in space, computer lab, courtyard, hygiene, and clothing area. However, it plans to continue operating its washroom facilities, transitional housing, shelter spaces, and providing three meals per day.

“It’s heartbreaking for us to limit access to so many vulnerable people, but it’s the only way we can meet the province’s new pandemic regulations,” says Grant McKenzie, communications director of Our Place. “However, even in a time of crisis, we need to make sure our family members are being looked after to the best of our ability.”

To reduce the potential spread of the Coronavirus to the most vulnerable, volunteer shifts have been cancelled and dedicated staff will step in to fill those roles.

“There is a lot of fear around what happens when this virus makes its way to the people we serve,” says McKenzie. “But our dedicated staff isn’t about to abandon this population. Our kitchen is already planning how it can continue to serve three meals per day on the street in front of 919 Pandora Avenue.”

Our Place is working to ensure that its staff and clients are properly protected, and practice social distancing to the best of their ability.

 “In order to place people at the appropriate distance apart, we will need to rework our shelter space,” says McKenzie.

To that end, Our Place will be closing its seasonal shelter as of Wednesday, and limiting the number of people who can access shelter mats at First Met and My Place.

“People will be displaced,” says McKenzie. “We are talking with the province to see if it can help us with an alternate housing plan for those people who have nowhere to go, but until that happens, people will be forced to sleep in parks and doorways.”

The greatest needs during this time are financial donations, and to assist those we care about most as we adjust our shelters to comply with health regulations:  single-person tents, sleeping bags and tarps. For donors not wishing to venture downtown, donations can be dropped off at New Roads Therapeutic Recovery Community, 94 Talcott Road in View Royal, Monday to Friday, 9am to 4:30pm. Financial donations can be made online at: https://www.ourplacesociety.com/donate

“It’s all hands on deck,” adds McKenzie. “And we need the public’s support, understanding and compassion more than ever.” ""

VictoriaBC,Chad_Abraxas,"Searching for Felipe Sanchez Hello, fellow Victorians! I recently got a new phone number (250 area code) and I have been getting inundated with FaceTime attempts from a sweet old lady named Elma Gamboa. I have explained to her many times that I am not the person she is looking for because I just got this new phone number, and the number is no longer being used by the person she is trying to contact.

I believe Elma is an elderly woman. She only speaks Spanish.

Through Google Translate,  I have been able to determine that she is trying to reach Felipe Sanchez. She doesn't know what city Felipe lives in--only that he lives in Canada. (I assume he is in Victoria or the general area because of the area code.) I have also been able to determine that Elma does not have any friends or family members she can turn to for help with figuring out how to reach Felipe.

Because of her general forgetfulness (can't seem to remember that this is no longer Felipe's phone number, can't remember the city he lives in, etc.) I think she may have some form of dementia and may need help with general day-to-day tasks. Felipe seems to be the only person she knows, and she is consistently trying to reach out to him.

If anyone knows a Felipe Sanchez in Victoria, who changed his phone number around the fall of 2022, please let him know that Elma Gamboa is trying to reach him and might need his help.

VictoriaBC,ChaoticMink,"Renting a downtown bachelor in a Capreit building Edit: updated my list with people’s feedback 

I’m hoping to move from Toronto to Victoria later this year. I’ve been looking at various affordable-ish buildings that might be a possibility to live in. I’d prefer to live alone, close to downtown, and avoid living in a basement, so one of Capreit’s relatively affordable bachelor units seems like a good option so far.

In Toronto, most people avoid purpose-built apartment buildings because they are terrible. I did some of my own research, and around 90% of apartment buildings in Toronto have cockroaches, and at leash 50% have or have had bedbugs or other pests. However, from my research so far, apartment buildings in Victoria seem a lot more decent (although I could be be wrong here).  

A few of the buildings I have been considering are: 

Yes: 
Victor Apartments: 976 Humboldt Street
Vancouver Villa: 710 Vancouver Street
Niagara Court Apartments: 535 Niagara Street

Maybe: 
Anondale Court: 443 Superior Street
Villa Apartments: 788-790 Dominion Road

No: 
Gorge Road Apartments: 215-221 Gorge Road East
Graham House: 1110 Queens Avenue

Unknown: 
Valencia Apartments: 660 Niagara Street
Lord Harley: 3220 Quadra Street

Other suggestions:
Continental House on Lampson Street

I am hoping someone may be able to provide experiences with these specific buildings, or renting from Capreit in general. I am also open to recommendations of other relatively affordable apartment buildings near downtown (ideally pet friendly, as I will likely have a small dog by the time I move). 

Thanks in advance!","Affordable, Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , Lived Experience, People with lived experience",1,True,0.0
VictoriaBC,CharityNeverFails,"Family Bicycle Stolen from Single Mother - Fort and Cook - 3 Oct 2018 At 6:45 am on the 2nd of October, while out on a walk with my puppy, I saw 2 men attempting to remove a bike lock- up stand from a bicycle they had stolen from out side of an apartment building at Fort and Cook. They were doing this across the street from Pioneer Square, on Meares St. I recognized the bicycle, as it is a very distinct bike that I had seen locked up at Fort and Cook frequently. 

I immediately jogged home and called the police, checking on the way to make sure that the bicycle wasn't in it's normal place. I was only a few blocks from home, so within 5 minutes of seeing the theft in progress, I had given the information to the dispatcher. I assumed that VicPD would be able to catch these thieves in the act and return the bike to it's proper owner, because they certainly weren't able to move very fast considering the huge chunk of metal and concrete that was attached to the bike, and they didn't look like they were having an easy time removing it when I saw them. 

Later that day, I checked the Stolen Bike Avengers Facebook group, and was sad to see that the bike I had reported had not been recovered by the police, and that the owner, a single mother, was incredibly distraught at the theft. 

I feel slightly guilty for not having said anything to the two men at the time, but it was dark, early in the morning and there was no one around should they become violent, etc. 

&#x200B;

The bike is a Taga 2.0 with rain cover attached. the frame is silver and cargo space is white/black/green. It is an Electric assist bike, however did not have the battery attached.

Temporary police file number is T18001261

But I see y’all taking your kids and pets and just going for it. I’m curious as to why you make that choice.

In particular the guy I saw walking two dogs—one smaller leashed (at least for crossing, was unleashed in the park,) with a second medium-sized trotting a few paces behind, off-leash. Who paused in jaywalking (at rush hour) because he wanted to wave and stop traffic so the second dog could cross coming up behind him. Which the oncoming traffic could not have been able to see due to the backed up line of cars waiting to turn left onto the highway.

Anyway I got to almost see this guy AND both his dogs get smeared across the road and I’m sure it didn’t feel great for him to experience or be honked at, but…sir, where do YOU get off yelling at the driver who had no way of knowing what the heck you were trying to do, or that a second dog NOT on a leash was tootling along behind you, just out of view, and then very much in his front blind spot?

VictoriaBC,Chris_cops_4_cancer,"Tour de Rock Fundraising Kicking Off Hello Everyone!

My name is Chris Van Swieten and I am a police officer with the City of Victoria. I am taking part in the 25th annual Tour de Rock this year and wanted to reach out to you locals to raise awareness and attempt to raise some money for Pediatric Cancer Research. Most of you who have lived in Victoria for a while know what Tour de Rock is but for those of who who do not I will break it down for you.

The “Tour de Rock” where first responders and media persons bike over 1200 kilometers over two weeks from the northern tip of Vancouver Island (Port Alice) through various communities ending in Victoria on the southern tip. Leading up to this ride is four and a half months of fundraising and extensive physical training.

80% of the money raised goes straight into cutting edge pediatric cancer research. This research targets new cancer treatments and studies into reducing the harm of chemotherapy so childhood cancer survivors have better quality of living post decease.

Ethan is a perfect example of how this research has helped save lives. He was a small child when he was diagnosed with leukemia. One of these research programs reached out to his family once they received the diagnosis and tested Ethan to see if he carried any high risk genes for the chemotherapy that he was slated to receive. This test showed that he didn’t have one but TWO of the high risk genes for heart failure. With this added information his doctor was able to select a safe medication and he is now a happy and healthy kid who’s only major side effect was some hearing loss. The hope for this specific research is that in the future anyone(not just children) receiving a cancer diagnosis will have this test to give them the best chance at survival.

The other 20% of the money goes toward a place called Camp Goodtimes which is an extraordinary camp experience in a medically-supervised, safety-focused and supportive environment where kids and families can escape the diagnosis and hospitals.

The Canadian Cancer Society is Canada’s largest cancer charity and is a certified charity that offers tax receipts for each donation.

With the breakdown complete I wanted to share a link with all of you where you can make donations to this amazing cause and help these brave children suffering from cancer.  If you made it this far thank you for your time and I included more links below with more information if you want to learn more.

VictoriaBC,Coconutbear8,"Housing experience Found a bedroom rental post from a Facebook group and moved into a 2-bedroom apartment in Oak Bay months ago. That person who posted the ad (retired teacher) lives in one of the bedrooms and rented the other bedroom to me.

It was stated on her post that a housing agreement was to be signed. When I asked her about the agreement on the first day, she said that there was no need for an agreement and that there was no written agreement with her previous roommates either. She said that it was a roommate situation instead of landlord-tenant and that we both just needed to give each other a clear month notice to end the tenancy.

She always presented herself as a charitable person, telling me that she volunteered and worked hard at the church, helped an elderly neighbor a lot, etc…

Ever since I moved in, she would always ask me for my daily schedule. She always wanted to know the exact time I would leave home and get back home. I honestly answered even though I felt very uncomfortable. After a while, I found that she had been getting into my room when I was away, and used some of my stuff. One day, after I asked her, “did you happen to get into my room today?” she was in shock and started stuttering. She kept asking how I knew. I told her some stuff in my room were moved. Then, she said she went into my room only to look out the window because her window was too filthy. I did not ask any other questions, and just said okay hesitantly as I was quite speechless to her reason. She then continued to say she did not touch a thing in my room, did not look at anything, did not snoop around and that if she was to snoop around she would not have moved anything to make it suspicious. I felt very uncomfortable and violated. Took some time to process the situation alone in my room and went to the living room to tell her, “could you let me know next time if you have to come into my room?” She said, “sorry, it won’t happen again…” We agreed to get a key entry doorknob, so a lock was installed for my bedroom 1/2 days after. 

After a couple days, she told me the tenancy was not working out for her and wanted me to move out as soon as possible. She said her son told her that since we were in a roommate situation we did not need any notice to end the tenancy. I asked why she thought it was not working out, she said she would explain later. Later that day, she said the way I responded, when I asked her whether she got into my room, was very strong. (In fact, I did not display any anger or negative emotions in that conversation.) She said my response triggered her childhood trauma about her abusive father. After several days, she said the tenancy was not working out because my response triggered her unpleasant memories about her stressful relationship with her daughter.

I sent out hundreds of messages looking for accommodation, and spent almost everyday riding buses to numerous places for viewing. All that time I wish I could spend on studying instead because academics has been my priority and is why I flew all the way to Victoria. It was physically and mentally exhausting. 

House searching was just too difficult and impeding my studies, after maybe 2 weeks I asked if it was okay for me to move out in January as there will be a lot more openings. She said okay. I tried to stay positive and nice, so I even said “thank you so much for giving me enough time to move out, I’m very grateful. Let me know how I can make the rest of my time here better for you.”

A number of other things that I felt uncomfortable hearing and knowing:

There’s a washroom in the common laundry room which was open for residents but was later installed a lock by the manager due to the pandemic. She showed me a stick trimmed from a cloth hanger and told me she used the stick to open the lock to use that washroom. And gave me an identical stick saying I could use that too. I never did as it didn’t feel right.

She told me not to report my income for tax and to play dumb with CRA if they ever find out.

“I know my son didn’t want to pick up the freezer from Langford and deliver it for me. But I think he owes me and should do it.”

“I have to drive my grandson for piano lessons so I do my laundry at their place to make it even. Gas is expensive.”

“I picked this apartment because I knew I wanted to live with a student and this location is on the bus route to UVic.”

At one point, I asked why she would want to know my daily schedule. She responded that she wanted to make sure she was not bothering me when watching videos. In fact, even when she knew I was home studying, she would still play videos out loud. Sometimes even past 10pm. 

She always talked on the phone about me. Twisted the stories, even when I had been really polite, respectful and caring. She was extremely chatty and I would very patiently listen to her talking about herself before the semester got busy. Later I was preoccupied with my coursework and always stayed in the room and she would complain to her friend about me being too quiet. It was really creepy hearing all those.

—————

At the end of the inspection on my move-out day, she said things were okay and she would refund the damage deposit later. After I left, she sent an email saying “I will need to do two loads of wash as the duvet is to be washed separately. Also there was much hair to cut out of the vacuum cleaner roller brush after I vacuumed your room.” So she kept $10 from the damage deposit.

I felt compelled to reply to that despite the amount being kept. I wrote “This is not what you have communicated when I left this morning. Damage deposit was agreed to be returned at the end of the inspection today. When I first moved in, there were a lot of white hair strands on the bed, bed sheets and duvet which took at least 2 washes to get rid of. [She claimed multiple times that the beddings were clean. I did not speak up at the time out of courtesy.] Although I did not vacuum the room this morning, I picked up the hair and also removed them with tapes before I left. [I picked up the hair by hand, then used industrial tape to remove the rest until the tape looked clear.]” I also quoted the section of ‘When can a landlord keep all or part of a deposit?’ from BC housing and tenancy website.

In her reply email, she said I only did a cursory wipe of the furniture (I used my own disinfecting wet wipes and it was not cursory.) Attached photos of the bottom shelf of the desk which I never used and a mirror with dust on the surface, saying there was dirt on them. The last part of the email went “I now have extra laundry and cleaning to do. You were only charged $10. Is that worth being so venomous about? Read the below and you will see that apparently you have no legal standing in the situation..”

I sent her another reply email which she did not respond to. Looking back, I feel the urge to do something for myself now. I was somehow too soft and didn’t fight for myself when I should have. This is a lesson for me. 

Thank you for reading this long post. I hope you can be in a good housing situation under such difficult housing market.

Edit: She told me a mail from BC insurance to me was recently delivered, and asked me to pick it up or give her a forward address. My friend picked up the mail from her, there were creases and folds on the envelope and tiny smudges on the letter.

VictoriaBC,Code-name_Moose,"Need help with a mental health issue Hey all, thanks for reading. I don't know where else to turn at this point. Sorry for the wall of text. 

My aunt has tried to kill herself. The first time was May 2013. It came as a shock to our family. 

She is in her 50's, but due to lack of oxygen at birth she was developmentally delayed. I don't know how best to describe her. She can function as an adult in some ways, but in others she is like a child. She has tantrums like a toddler at times, and has poor ability to grasp consequences. She has a lot of trouble expressing herself. She has always lived with my grandmother, who is now in her late 80's and is in denial about the situation with her daughter. 

A month or so ago, my aunt tried to kill herself again. Both times were by taking pills. We told grandma that all pills have to be kept from my aunt, but my grandma seems to think that my aunt is just behaving like a bratty child. She can't seem to grasp the seriousness and isn't making much of an effort to keep the drugs secured. 

The first overdose was worse than the second. It really messed up her body. She was in hospital for several days, and then was sent home. Since then, she has had tinnitus (or something similar) that is causing her to basically lose her mind. She goes to the emergency room every week or two. She sees her family doctor or clinic doctors on a weekly basis. They keep *fucking* prescribing pills!!! All she wants is for the noises in her head to go away. There is nothing medically wrong with her that can be detected at this point (she has had all sorts of tests, MRIs, etc). 

After the attempt last month, she told us she wants to go into a care facility. The problem is that she doesn't qualify for one. After the first OD she was clearly in a major state of depression. She wouldn't talk to anyone anymore. After the second attempt, things seemed better. I thought maybe it is because she thought she would get the help she wants/needs, but now I'm not so sure. I worry that she has made up her mind to die, and that is what is making her feel better. 

I just found out that she tried to drink chemicals a few days ago, but my grandma stopped her. 

We are at a loss. She can't talk to counsellors because she doesn't understand that they're not there to help with the tinnitus. She just babbles about her head. We truly believe that she will keep trying to kill herself until she succeeds. We don't know how to keep her safe. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? Can we have her committed? Hospital staff seem completely unwilling to do anything other than prescribe pills and send her home. We are desperate to help her. I've posted enough info here for my friends/acquaintances to recognize me, but I don't know where else to turn.

VictoriaBC,Coffee4thewin,"When it comes to housing we should allow people to build lots of 3 story townhouses. When it comes to supply, we don't build enough family starter homes. Hi,

It seems like the city of Victoria is asking for ideas on what to do about affordability. I think most of us can agree that single-family only zoning is not really that productive. However, I think there's a height restriction in a lot of Victoria which should probably be removed.

Personally, I don't care about how many new condos are built. The number we should focus on is how many family starter homes are built. My definition of a starter home would be 3 bed 2 bathroom and 1500-2000 SF.

Any family looking for this has a hard time.

Let's take a look at a good example. This listing is from Calgary and is 3 Stories tall.

[https://www.rew.ca/properties/3640323/171-3437-42-street-northwest-calgary-ab?property\_click=map](https://www.rew.ca/properties/3640323/171-3437-42-street-northwest-calgary-ab?property_click=map)

I think if we were to rezone SFH and replace them with these, lots of people would be happy. This particular unit doesn't have a basement, but I have lived in townhomes like this one that had a basement and it was actually quite nice.

3 stories isn't THAT tall and being around them isn't too overbearing.

I also know there is lots of red tape around building anything anywhere. Perhaps the red tape could be reduced for family starter homes in order for developers to have an incentive to build this kind of unit.

I see places getting ripped up to build super small unlivable units. What's the point?

When it comes to supply please push for family-sized units. Nothing below 1500 SF.

VictoriaBC,CoffeeGeeker,"Is Victoria ready for a Coffee Lab? (and introduction) Hey all. I'm Mark from CoffeeGeek.com. My wife and I will be moving to Victoria this fall, from Vancouver. One of my goals in the next year or two is setting up something I originally had in Vancouver in 2009-11; the CoffeeGeek Lab. What was it? [The best way to explain is to point you to an article](http://coffeegeek.com/opinions/coffeeatthemoment/10-02-2009) when it was first opened. Back then, it was a small space (about 600 sq.ft kitted out to the max).

The TL:DR is that the purpose of the lab is to educate consumers on quality coffee, to test and evaluate coffee equipment, and to test and rate coffees. The first lab was essentially ""non profit"" (any income it derived barely covered the space's rent).

Once we're established in Victoria, one of my prime goals is to set up a new lab in a retail / storefront / business location, providing a wider range of educational services, but also providing a lot of free and inclusive services just to introduce people to better coffee. I have a detailed business plan for the lab, and again, the goal is not profit driven, though, unlike last time, there is a curriculum of educational classes around coffee that at the very least should cover the lease and operating expenses, as well as salaries for the specialized educators the Lab will be making use of.

The Lab will provide the following:

* educational classes on all aspects of quality coffee, from beginner to advanced.
* a well stocked library of coffee knowledge, including well over 150 books and (at last count) 1,250 magazines specializing in coffee and espresso, from around the world.
* demonstrator machines covering the gamut of home coffee brewing
* weekly ""open house"" sessions where people can just drop by and visit to taste good coffee, ask questions about improving coffee in the home, and more.
* a weekly coffee cupping session where we explore a great coffee from roasters around the world.
* functioning and ready-to-go brewing and espresso stations for people to check out and learn about coffee and espresso making on home setups costing from $200 to $2,500 and more. 

The lab will also host a photography studio space (primarily for my use though, when reviewing and evaluating coffee and espresso machines) and of course, being a lab, will have a dedicated section for evaluating and testing coffee and espresso machines.

What the CoffeeGeek Lab will not be doing:

* There will be no sales of coffee machines, espresso machines, grinders or any other kind of equipment. It's not a store. (that said, from time to time, used machines that have outlived their use in the Lab may be offered up for sale to visitors and students of Lab classes (these will be one-off sales)).
* There will be no sales of any roasted (or green coffee). Again, it is not a store.
* It will not be a ""cafe"". It is a work and education space.
* The Lab will not be representing any specific (or exclusive) brand of machine or coffee (that said, we may hold events focusing on specific brands, but those will be one time events)
* The lab will not be partnered with, or exclusively sponsored by any one company, (which includes Victoria's awesome coffee roasters and cafes) in the Lab's day to day operation. This one's tricky though, because to ensure consistency in the coffee I've used for machine evaluations and classes, I've had to enter into arrangements with roasters so I have a similar blend week after week - and this will probably continue in the lab - but - I pay for those coffees (wholesale cost); they aren't given to me for review and educational use in return for free advertising. Also, we may host one-time special events in partnership with various companies, roasters and cafes, but the Lab will never be ""brought to you by..."" or ""The XYZ Company CoffeeGeek Lab"", if you catch my drift. I fiercely value to independent nature I've managed to maintain for the CG brand over the years.

As part of my business plan, I need to evaluate and analyse the market more. I have been doing this low-key for about a year now - polling people in the industry that I do know (including those on the Island!); polling members of the website as to what they want in a lab and if they'd even consider visiting Victoria and include the Lab as one of their destination events (good news is, many, many people would love to visit Victoria!) and more.

But I'm posting this here now to ask you, redditors of Victoria, what you think. You're a specific demographic of Victoria, and one that I am obviously targeting the lab space toward, but the reality of Victoria (and the Island) population numbers vs Vancouver's, as well as Victoria's island-locked status weighs heavily. Are there enough interested parties to sustain the lab through well priced, economical classes. Is there enough interest so that weekly events (the free ones) would see enough traffic. What parts of Victoria (or Saanich) do you think would be a good location for this Lab?

And most importantly, is this kind of Coffee Lab of interest to you and your circle of friend and family? What would you like to see in this kind of lab?

What's more fun than getting together and doing what you love, with people that love you?

So come on out and meet people from the industry.. Hang out and work on your own projects, start a new one, or take the challenge: Make a game, start to finish, in 48 hours!

The alternative is hiring security during the night, which is costly. It will run late into the night, and start early in the morning.

**Price of Entry**

Free! But there will be a box for donations if you are feeling charitable. Any donations received will be used to help offset the cost of organizing the event. If there is a profit on the event, the surplus will go into the UVic GameDev club fund.

**But I'm not a Programmer...**

Bring Settlers of Catan. I want to play that game. Like... you bring a bro, and I'll bring a bro, and we'll just bro out the four of us. A real [bro-sesh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JUeDQbR-ts). 

Bring a board game. Bring a game you love. Game Jams are more exciting when there are more people so just come and hang out for a while.

However, please be respectful of those developers who are ""In the Zone"" and do not wish to be distracted. Developers will be thrilled to chat with you about their games, but probably not for too long.

**Okay so wait, what is happening exactly. You keep saying weird things. Is this real life?**

This *is* real life! Here is the list of events!

*Uvic GameDev presents Minecraft!* 
You know the dril. Play with a friend, or play alone. Whatever. It don't make no matter to me. Listen to me shoehorn excuses into my argument on how the skills in Minecraft are directly transferable to Game Development. 

*Board Game Jam*
 - Use existing board game pieces, sit down, and make a new game. Try it out on someone. Improve it. Do it again. Wear a hat.

*5 Minute Game Jam* 
- Making a Game (or piece of music) in 5 minutes; The results can be absolutely incredible. It is a spectator sport upon itself. My weapon of choice, Game Maker.

*Show and Tell*
 - Showcase some of the best games that have come out of Victoria in the last few years!

**I'm interested in doing some game development, but I have no experience...**

I suggest using these free Game Making utilities:

[Game Maker Lite](http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker/windows)
- Perfect for someone who has not programmed at all. Simple and powerful drag and drop interface, built onto a versatile scripting language. Pro version is affordable, and comes with additional features.

[Adventure Game Studios](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/)
- Versatle and intuitive for Point and Click Adventure Game Development. Free to use, free to develop and publish games with. Best for those with some programming, art, or game development experience prior.

**What's the 'sitch on internet? Food?**

I am working towards getting stable internet access available for all attendees. Unfortunately, this is not pinned down yet. My priority is for those who are developing, as they will need to be as efficient as possible. Luckily, if you are A UVic student, you'll have no problem using the school computers.

[Kano Apps](http://www.kanoapps.com/careers/), a Victoria based studio is sponsoring the event by supplying some food and drinks. However, depending on the number of people who arrive, supplies may be limited. You might want to bring some food, especially if you plan on developing a game.

**Okay! I want in!**

Go to the Global Game Jam website and register so you can post your game and your game's screenshots online. Remember, this is a global event, so people are doing this all around the world. If you use social media like Twitter or Tumblr, use the #GGJ and #screenshotsaturday tags to meet new awesome people just like you. After the event, post your games on the [LEVEL UP](http://www.meetup.com/levelup/) forums!


See you there. :)

I've been there for breakfast many times and been to events catered by Castro, but this was my first dinner.

VictoriaBC,Commercial_Aide3391,"Constraints on garbage removal services? I'm new to Victoria (and to Canada), and one of the things that I've noticed in my first few months here is that garbage removal services *seem* to be constrained. I took a look at the 2012 bylaws for the City of Victoria - maybe I am interpreting the legalese incorrectly, but it sounds like each household is entitled to one can that is picked up biweekly (?). And the bylaw is somewhat confusing when it comes to multiple units. 

Maybe these legal limits explain why I've noticed people making extra trips to the dump to get rid of garbage, as well as locks on garbage cans (but not on other types of refuse). 

I'm curious as to whether folks here find that their garbage services are insufficient for the garbage that is produced by modern households. If yes, how long has that been the case? What has the local conversation over solid waste removal services looked like? And is this a Victoria issue, a B.C. issue, or a Canada issue?

I'm also really curious about the variety of items I see in recycling bins that cannot be recycled in other countries, such as yogurt containers. Does the city have the technology to recycle these items, or are people recycling them to save space in their garbage containers, even though they end up in the landfill?

PS - I understand that some households work very hard to limit, or even eliminate their garbage production.  It's genuinely awesome if you're one of those households that has invested the time and resources needed to do this. But it could be hard for other households to make these investments, and I'm really asking to hear from these folks.","Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness , Peers Victoria Resources Society ",1,False,46.15384615384615

VictoriaBC,CorriChris,"Dogs required to be licensed in Victoria, why not bicycles? Apparently, Victoria has one of the youngest (4 months) licensing requirements for dogs in Canada. Pay $60 a year, if you don't have a license, it's a $120 fine. My guess is the licensing is there to sustain dog friendly infrastructure (parks, etc) and dog / pet / animal services the city pays for. 

**I'm not opposed to dog licensing** (except going after puppies under a year old, like many other municipalities; seems like an extra cash grab). 

But why not bicycle licensing. I'm sure my question will get me downvoted into the 6th layer of hell for suggesting it, but bicycle licensing would a) help greatly reduce bicycle theft, b) help pay for and maintain bicycle infrastructure in the city, and c) make cyclists more responsible for following the laws of the road (it's easier to ticket them, I assume, if their bicycle is licensed). 

Point ( a ) is the most obvious benefit. Bicycle theft here and in Vancouver are absolutely at horrible levels.

""With the heavy rains over the weekend expected to continue in the days ahead, many communities in our province continue to struggle with flooding and the impacts to highways and other infrastructure. 

As a result, today government extended the provincial state of emergency to December 14, and extended the emergency order limiting fuel in the southwest region of B.C.

While the fuel restrictions are working, it’s important that we all continue to do our part by limiting non-essential travel. With that in mind, the BC Public Service will further delay the implementation of telework agreements to January 4, 2022.

If you are able to work from home, you can continue to do so on a full-time basis where operationally feasible. Those who need to be in the workplace, are encouraged to minimize vehicle use where possible, especially in the Lower Mainland and on Vancouver Island.

My sincere thanks to all our colleagues working so incredibly hard to support communities impacted by this most recent challenge. Know that your efforts are making all the difference to so many British Columbians right now.

A reminder as well that resources are always available through the Employee and Family Assistance Services for all employees if you need support. And if you are looking for a way to help those impacted by flooding, which includes some of our own colleagues, you can donate to the Canadian Red Cross through PECSF. Information on how to do that is available on the Compass intranet site. 

I know we all would prefer to be approaching the end of the year with more optimism than we may be feeling right now. But we will continue to work through all of this together, supporting our communities and each other as we always do. 

Take care of yourselves and those close to you.

VictoriaBC,CrazyEvilCatDan,"BCPSA Return to Office delayed to Dec 01 from November 22 From the Deputy Minister to the Premier/Head of the BC Public Service, Lori Wanamaker's email: 

""Good afternoon. 
As you know, the damage caused by this week’s flooding continues to have a profound impact on many communities across B.C. Earlier this week, the government declared a provincial State of Emergency. Today, an emergency order has been issued implementing essential steps to support communities in managing the ongoing impact of this natural disaster in the days ahead. This includes restrictions on unnecessary travel to help manage the impact of temporary restrictions on the fuel supply. 

In response to this order, the BC Public Service will delay the implementation of telework agreements scheduled for this coming Monday. Employees who are able to work from home can continue to do so on a full-time basis where operationally feasible. Those employees who need to be in the workplace are encouraged to minimize vehicle use where possible, whether through carpooling or using public transit. 

The measures announced today are in effect until December 1, and so we will plan to resume the implementation of telework agreements at that time. I will communicate any further changes closer to that date. Please note this change applies to the implementation of telework agreements only and does not change the timeline for the COVID-19 vaccination policy. 

I know this is short notice as many of you planned to return to your regular workplaces starting Monday, and I appreciate your flexibility as we adapt to this rapidly evolving situation. 

This is the latest challenge in an already very difficult year on so many fronts. My thanks to our many colleagues working so tirelessly on the flood and landslide response. And my thoughts are with all those directly impacted by the devastation in their communities. Resources are always available through the Employee and Family Assistance Services for all employees if you need support. We’re all better able to take care of others when we take care of our own well-being too.

Have you or someone you know seen a sexually inappropriate doctor at a walk-in clinic in Victoria? If so, you’re not alone.

You may remember [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/atst4y/creepy_doctor/) from two years ago. TL;DR: I was addicted to pain pills a number of years ago. I finally sought help at a methadone clinic but the doctor was incredibly sexually inappropriate. Recovery was never discussed; he kept asking if I needed a pap test and we ended up trading sexual favours for pain pills. This happened at the walk-in clinic he *still* works at. I finally sought help at another methadone clinic but could’ve gotten clean sooner if it weren’t for the abuse I suffered from this doctor.

FYI, I am now clean and going to school to work in mental health and addictions.

Early next month (July 2021), there will be a hearing by the Disciplinary Committee at the College of Physicians. I am hoping to have his license to practice revoked.

From my last post, I was able to connect with another person who had a similar experience as me with the same doctor. Their complaint will be heard along with mine next month. Recently, there was a post on the Survivor Stories Project instagram page which will hopefully help the case against the doctor as well.

With this post, I’m again hoping to find others who have experienced similar abuse from this doctor. If you have, and are willing to make a formal complaint to the College of Physicians before the hearing in early July, please email me at [togetherstrong2019@outlook.com](mailto:togetherstrong2019@outlook.com).

Today at Cook and Rockland I was halfway through a crosswalk on the walk sign when someone decided to turn left from ahead of me, coming straight at me. I don't know how they didn't see me, I was wearing a green hoodie and I'm 8 months pregnant with a big belly. It's getting dark earlier these days but that intersection is very well lit. But it seems they didn't spot me. I waved my arms to get their attention, but my legs froze because I couldn't decide whether to run backwards or forwards. At the last second I ran forwards and they missed me by 1-2 feet. They sped off without even looking at me. I was terrified. I thought I was going to die, or at least be so injured that my baby might die. Afterwards, I thought maybe I had died and the scuttle to the curb and hyperventilating was just my brain producing hallucinations in the last moments of my life.

What is Shaw's strategy at this point?  Will they call back again in a month or two and try to offer me the same deal, or will I have to revert to playing the game of signing with Telus, then cancelling in two years and going back to Shaw, etc?

VictoriaBC,DaveThompsonVictoria,"Homelessness in Vic - an emerging vision I'm hearing an increasingly shared vision of what's needed to address homelessness in Victoria and elsewhere. I'm not the expert, but I talk to a lot of people about this, pretty much daily. 

BTW this isn't everything needed to address homelessness - just a start. Also this isn't focused on other problems like mental health, drug toxicity / overdoses, street disorder, crime. Those will need other interventions. However, addressing homelessness would help for some of them.

Ok here goes. And your ideas of how to address this challenge are welcome!

Needed actions include:

1. Establishment of permanent affordable housing and supportive housing, with the full range of wrap-around supports and services. This is already being carried out by the province and there is federal support, and this needs to be scaled up significantly and quickly. 

By the way, affordable housing and supportive housing are distinct things. Some unhoused people will only need affordable housing. Some will need supportive housing, ie. housing + supports and services.

2. While that scales up, establishment of temporary designated spaces where people who are unhoused can shelter (eg. tent sites or tiny homes), with peer and provincial supports and management. Not in parks. Not on sidewalks. Not in doorways. Planned spaces, likely on hardscapes.

3. An adequate number of safe consumption sites, and an over-abundance of detox, treatment, rehabilitation, transition housing. Why an over-abundance? Because when someone is ready for detox and treatment, it needs to be available right then. Not 6 weeks later or even 2 weeks. We need to provide clear, open pathways out.

4. Finally, and this is key, we need an intentional and planned distribution of all of the above at a regional and provincial level, not concentrated in one city.

After all, this is the first time Victoria has ever had rain in the fall, so we couldn't have figured this out in the summer, or the spring.

We couldn't have used any underused sports fields or nearby arenas. Nobody could see that they were available.

Nobody knew these people would get flooded, and so now we should all donate more tents and sleeping bags, to replace the wrecked ones.

But these tents and bags will last forever, see. There won't be any more rain this winter. 

Because there never is.

And by the way, when the cold sets in for a couple of weeks, nobody in those tents is going to use a camp stove to stay warm.  Nobody.

BS news headlines and Reddit threads suggest Victoria is some huge homeless magnet. 

Reality: it's a problem across the Island, across BC, and across Canada.

Homeless camps form, get pushed out / broken up, and then form again elsewhere. They're a *symptom.* You need to fix the underlying problems.

It's not solely caused by Lisa Helps or City Council. And they can't solve it.

It's caused by poverty. By municipal bylaws that jack housing costs. By addiction -- looking at you big pharma. By deinstitutionalization of persons with mental illness. By federal and provincial governments downloading costs for decades. Etc.

If my original point wasn't clear I appologize, but I will keep all the original wording as well for transparency. Also I was talking about gas prices, of which the carbon tax is a small portion of and not the main reason it keeps rising. Why people derailed the thread to go on about the tax is beyond me. But my bad for going with it.

**One final edit cause I'm tired of the same conversation:** I come from a small mining town where transit is nonexistent, jobs are often at least a half hour drive away, and at least a quarter of the population is low income in trailers. Rising costs will literally ruin lives well before the decreased costs from innovations will be seen in cities let alone these small rural places. Remember that not everyone lives your life. Maybe you can afford a new electric car, and maybe you have a job which you can actually bus or bike to, and maybe you have more than a single grocery store in your town and options to actually buy local. So so many people in our province, and more so in our country, don't. Rising costs hurts so many people who are just trying to get by without the options to just live greener that us privileged Victorians have. Why are we ok with this instead of fighting and searching for better changes and incentives? I came here looking for help finding said things, to find people interested in the same. Instead I largely found the opposite.

I'm not talking about lowering personal costs or carbon footprints, clearly driving less will do both, but that isn't always an option. I'm talking about actually getting the government and companies to listen and deal with these astronomical prices. $1.54 is ridiculous.

Even if we want to accept high prices as an incentive to drive less, it is only going to cause companies to increase their prices - especially around food. Even if you stopped driving altogether you will feel the effects of higher gas prices. There are better ways to reduce emissions without harming all civilians than raising gas prices. So what can us regular joes actually do to support this? 

Edit: To everyone implying I'm anti-environment, or that I don't understand the point of higher prices is to decrease drivers - this is not true and you didn't get what I am saying. I'm 100% for less driving and less emissions, as I clearly said. I drive maybe once a month perosonally, I bike and walk everywhere I can, busing the longer distances. When I do drive it is mainly to load up on groceries and I make sure to bring all my roommates to minimze trips needed.

However, I don't think increasing prices (especially of gas) is the way to go. Gas prices specifically won't affect companies, not if we want food and other goods, instead the prices of said things will increase to compensate. There are other ways to incentivize greener travel without driving up the cost of living for everyone, including those who don't drive anyways. I'm looking for ways to advocate and support these alternatives so that we achieve less emissions without making life even more expensive.

Also people saying you don't have to drive are thinking very small picture. Yea maybe I don't while at school, and you don't, but everyone going to work at a mine needs to. Cops need to. Food transporters need to. If we want these services we need driving, and increasing the costs these services incur only increases what we have to pay, even if you never drive - it won't decrease their emissions.","Low income, Low-income, People with lived experience",0,False,0.0

VictoriaBC,Deify,"Update on the downtown gym which was ""opting out"" of the vaccine passport. They now require it I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/pn8kvj/my_gym_is_opting_out_from_the_vaccine_passport_is/) more than a month ago about Studio 4 choosing not to require the vaccine passport. Earlier this week I got an email where they state that they must either start requiring the passport or be shut down. 

During the past month I chose to go to Winchester, have a pint and wait for all this to blow over, so I tested the policy yesterday by going in normally without showing the passport, and to my pleasure the front desk does indeed require it now.

VictoriaBC,Deli_Cinq,"URGENT: Lost black and white boston terrier named Vicki - recently spotted near Butchart Gardens. Please help find her! She's been out in the rain for three days and her owners are desperate to find her. UPDATE (Oct 6 8:59am): Vicki has been found! 
Update post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/1nudwb/update_vicki_the_dog_has_been_found_after_being/

PREVIOUS UPDATE (Oct 4th 8:33am):

Robin (one of Vicki's owners) has again rescheduled his flight home to Sunday Oct 13th, but his partner, Miho, has left for Japan. The family is asking all interested helpers to do so by handing out flyers at the trail entrance, keeping dogs on leash on the trail, and staying clear of the feeding station (if you happen upon it). Vicki needs to feel like the feeding station is a safe place in order for the live trap to work. If you see Vicki, mark your exact location and call the family immediately (250-544-1599).

PREVIOUS UPDATE (Oct 1st, 1:52pm):

Vicki hasn't been seen since 6am yesterday (Sep 30th). Helpers are encouraged to come to the area to hike, but it's best to leave other dogs at home. Vicki's owners are permanently camped at Benvenuto and Wallace Drive and can answer questions if anyone is coming out to help. They have set up a food station in the wooded area with a video camera they can monitor. Vicki hasn't approached the food yet, but everyone's still hopeful she can be found. If you see her: do not try to call her, do not try to chase her or grab her. Call her owners immediately @ 250 544 1599.

PREVIOUS UPDATE (Sep 29th, 6:30pm):

Another sighting about 2 hours ago, again at the entrance to Tod Inlet Trail. The new strategy is NOT to bring strangers or strange dogs to the Tod Inlet Trail entrance on Wallace right now; the plan NOW is to just have ONLY Miho & Robin (her owners) out there, talking to one another, conversing normally, in calm tones, and THEN it is believed that Vicki will pop out for them (but she won't pop out if strangers are there).
The storm is brewing, moving in now... it's crunch time; if they are going to get her, it needs to be still and silent --except for them, their CALM voices-- on Wallace Drive right now. Your help, however --AND THIS GOES FOR ANYONE AND EVERYONE WANTING TO COME DOWN THERE RIGHT NOW-- is needed to alert the residents, personally going door to door, along Amwell Drive and all its side streets (all the little cul-de-sacs), making sure all residents know to CALL VICKI'S FAMILY (250 544 1599) if they spot her, but NOT to try and grab her, or even to try and call her by name.

PREVIOUS UPDATE (Sep 29th, 10:30am): 

Vicki was sighted in the night at around 3am at the entrance to the Tod Inlet Trail. The driver of the car tried to get her, but she is too fast. There had been a trap set for her last night overnight but it did not work.
The rains and high winds are coming imminently. PLEASE, if you can come down to Wallace Dr and use your EYES to help spot her this morning or at any point today, the family would be so grateful... the storm hits full force tonight at about 6pm.

If you spot Vicki, do not call her name, just CALL HER FAMILY!

She was only here three days before she escaped and bolted away in fear.

If you havn't taken the opportunity before I would highly recommend it. Plus the inside of the building is gorgeous, I can't imagine what it would cost to build it today, given the cost of materials.

Pretty par for the course for what you would expect from our political process. Some takeaways:

* Our conservatives (BC United) are consistent with their rhetoric. They repeatedly described our current economic landscape as ""the NDP squeeze on the middle class"", ignoring all global trends putting pressure on every economy. They called for the sitting government to ""give the middle class a break"". Clearly the implication is to vaguely cut taxes, but they provided no plan for how to do this without slashing our already strained services. They repeatedly referred to a salary raise for support staff as a ""secret raise"", despite it being a matter of public record. They offer nothing but complaints about costs, but provide no solutions, and ignore all global trends. The only thing they seem to care about is soundbites that appeal to their supporters. They had no rebuttal for the NDP laying out the tens of millions of dollars that went to funding hospitals, schools, and infrastructure in the rural communities that elected their United Party representatives. Or that coming out of covid that BC had the best credit rating in the nation. It must be easy to be a conservative politician, all you have to do is complain about taxes and ignore reality then your constituents will elect you time and time again.

* The only critic who meaningfully held the NDP to account for their policies and spending was Adam Olsen (Green). He called out the Health Minister for having insufficient oversight and accountability for funding going to private healthcare providers who failed to deliver **thousands** of hours of care that they received funding for.

* The NDP failed to pushback on the criticism coming from the conservatives. They should call them out and ask them to provide a budget plan that doesn't rely on slashing spending on healthcare, education, or infrastructure.

* The BC Conservative Party only cared about a single issue: dirty words in a book found in a middle school library

* All the parties paid lip service to Truth and Reconciliation, and Missing/Murdered Indigenous Women (Girls, Trans 2s+), and that we need to do and spend more. However I wonder if that same impassioned pleading is going to be hold up when it comes time to vote on the budget, or if certain parties will suddenly not support the issue. Oh, and the Conservative Party leader failed to acknowledge Trans/gender minorities, only women & girls.

tl;dr Conservatives never have a plan to improve things, only to slash spending and reduce taxes for businesses under the guise of it being ""breaks for the middle class""","Community Plan to End Homelessness , Healthcare , Service provider ",0,True,8.333333333333332

VictoriaBC,DesharnaisTabarnak,"Question: Breaking Lease Due To Noise & Liquidated Damages Sorry for littering this sub with yet another tenancy post, but...

&#x200B;

Seems like I drew the short end of the stick and rented a condo below noisy owners. Newish concrete building, sought second opinions from residents and realtors, researched online posts, and everything pointed towards peace and quiet within. Appeared true when I first moved in, then the random stomping started early mornings, then all sorts of noise throughout the day, now I can't sleep or focus on work/study with random ass shit getting through my headphones and white noise as if I lived under a fucking basketball court. And thanks to COVID, I can't go anywhere else to avoid the noise.

I had sent a formal complaint to the strata back in November, complained to my property managers, they sent a letter to the owners earlier in the month - nada. It only got worse. Already know I have no choice except to move out. Hooray for sharing a roof under people who don't give a flying fuck about measly tenants.

&#x200B;

Anyways, my whining aside, my tenancy agreement has a ""Liquidated Damages"" clause that forces me to pay $500 if I break my lease early. I looked up legislation and there's nothing wrong with it, but the law doesn't give any relief for liquidated damages if a tenant is forced out due to extenuating circumstances. I am allowed to go to the Tenancy Board over noise if it diminished the value of my tenancy, but it's a lot of time and resources to invest over something rather abstract, as well as antagonistic to my property managers, if I were to do that over a relatively small sum.

Should I just break the lease and eat the liquidated damage $$$, or is there an expectation from the property managers to provide relief from that sum - given the circumstances under which I'm moving out?",Point in Time,1,False,11.11111111111111

When I finally get to the desk I get scheduled for the one time frame I can't do in the afternoon. I plead to be assigned a later time but the admin refuses. I'm limping on one leg so I can't exactly swing by until I arbitrarily get assigned a better time and I can't drive around town for better options during a busy workday so better luck tomorrow and hope my other leg holds out I guess.

And I know this is not an isolated experience. Many of us have no family doctors and have to rely on walk ins for primary care, but clinics are increasingly overwhelmed so that when you do get to see a doctor they will hurry you up or ask if you want a prescription, then move the queue along as fast as possible. I've gone straight to ER several times and honestly the wait there is way better than getting no appreciable care at clinics, but it goes to show how broken the system is.

UPDATE: 🚔Unprovoked attack in downtown Victoria leaves man injured; one arrest made🚔

A man wielding a metal pole attacked a downtown Victoria vendor this afternoon, causing non-life-threatening injuries. The incident happened in downtown Victoria’s lower causeway tourism area. More from VicPD: 

Victoria, BC – Patrol officers arrested a man in Victoria’s Inner Harbour today after an unprovoked attack on a vendor and their display.

At approximately 4:30 p.m. today, Patrol officers were called to the intersection of Government and Belleville streets for a report of a man swinging a large metal pole at people and vendors’ displays. Several officers immediately responded and located the suspect on the Lower Causeway of the Inner Harbour. The suspect remained in possession of a metal pole. Officers provided voice commands, with a firearm and conductive energy weapon drawn, in order to protect the safety of the public and themselves. When the man did not acknowledge police commands, officers took physical control of the suspect to take him into custody without further incident.

Officers investigated and learned that the suspect had attacked a vendor’s display with the metal pole. The suspect then physically assaulted the vendor and left. The victim, a man, suffered non-life-threatening injuries in the assault.

Officers transported the man to cells where he was held in custody. The suspect, a 31-year-old man, faces recommended charges of assault with a weapon, mischief, and breach of a release order.

This file remains under investigation.

My gf and I are going to have a short vacation in Victoria from Thursday, Feb 26 to March 2. We are staying at the Grand Pacific and do not have much experience on the island (we live in Surrey). We also have a vehicle.

I attended a psychology conference (NOWCAM) last year in Victoria, and I went to this really nice jazz place (can't remember the name) and Big Bad John's - both were very fun experiences. I also walked around downtown quite a bit and went to some nice restaurants along the waterfront. 

Any suggestions on events that may be happening (I understand it may be scarce due to the Winter season) during that time - or in general - would be greatly appreciated. We will probably be staying in one night to binge watch House of Cards (yay!). We are both 25 and enjoy anything novel and stimulating. We like partying, but nothing too excessive. We also like trying any and all types of cuisine (although I am a bit wary of Thai food, unless it is fusion). My gf really likes Greek food. We also love gambling, but shopping might be more practical for this vacation.

EDIT: I also love to snowboard (gf is still doing lessons; only gone once) and have been severely deprived this season -_- I have a pass to Mt. Seymour, and they have a deal with Mt. Washington that allows me to use my pass there (while Seymour is closed), but I don't think we want to commit to the 3-hour drive each way.

VictoriaBC,DoddersEspinosa,"BCGEU negotations: employer explains their offer The deputy minister of the Public Service Agency sent this email to all government employees today, I guess to try to appeal to us directly? Negotiations must have ended badly between the two sides....


> Update on negotiations with the BCGEU
Good afternoon.

As I have mentioned in my previous messages, the Public Service Agency has been working to achieve a fair and reasonable settlement in our bargaining with the BCGEU. We remain committed to that goal and open to the collective bargaining process.

However, many of you will have seen the latest bulletin from the BCGEU indicating the union is planning targeted strike action following a breakdown in talks between the union and the employer. With the potential of future strike action, I think there is value in sharing the monetary offer the employer has tabled with the BCGEU with you directly so you have that full context of where negotiations stand.

The employer’s monetary offer is as follows:

* Year-1: $2,500 lump sum payment for those working at least 50% full-time and pro-rated for those working less.
* April 1, 2022:  Increase rates of pay by an average of 3.76%.
* The average increase of 3.76% consists of a $0.25 per hour increase and a 3% general wage increase.  The value of the flat $0.25 per hour equals an approximate increase of 0.76% for the average BCGEU employee.
* April 1, 2023:  Increase rates of pay by an average of 3.23%.
* The average increase of 3.23% consists of a $0.25 per hour increase and a 2.5% general wage increase.  The value of the flat $0.25 per hour equals an approximate increase of 0.73% for the average BCGEU employee.
* Year-3:  Increase rates of pay by up to 4%.
* The increase of up to 4% consists of a guaranteed 3% general wage increase (effective the first pay period after April 1, 2024) and up to a further 1% increase that would be payable after February 1, 2025 if inflation exceeds 9.5% during the three calendar years beginning in 2022. 

Under this offer, the average BCGEU employee would receive wage increases of up to 10.99% over the three-year term of the collective agreement. To help understand what this offer could mean for you, I have attached the following one-page summary which was shared with the union on June 27, 2022. We have also tabled enhancements related to health and safety processes.

You should talk to your union representative if you have questions about potential strike action. There are additional processes under the Labour Relations Code and our collective agreement that must also be followed before either party would be in a strike or lockout position.

The Public Service Agency and the BCGEU are continuing to negotiate essential services levels, which must be completed prior to any strike action. In this case, “essential service” refers to the minimum staffing levels that must be maintained to prevent immediate and serious harm to the health, safety, or welfare of British Columbians during a strike.

I was pleased to hear that the union is committed to reaching an agreement, and I assure you the employer is as equally committed to reaching a negotiated settlement under government’s Shared Recovery Mandate. We remain open to resuming bargaining when the union’s bargaining committee wishes to do so.",Community Plan to End Homelessness ,1,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,DoddersEspinosa,"BCGEU responds to employer's ""take it or leave it"" offer Followup to yesterday's post about the employer emailing all government employees directly to promote their ""fair and reasonable"" offer: https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/vsadbe/bcgeu_negotations_employer_explains_their_offer/

----

**Special message from your Public Service Bargaining Committee**

Last fall, we conducted the most detailed and comprehensive preparations for public service negotiations in BCGEU history. This included reviewing nearly 500 proposals from union locals, 5800 bargaining survey results and polling results from over 5000 members. By engaging in extensive consultation with you, we learned about your challenges, your needs, and your priorities for this round of bargaining.
 
Your direction has been and continues to be clear: you want a fair and equitable contract that addresses the rising cost-of-living and recognizes how critically important public service workers are to British Columbians.
 
Time to catch up and keep up
 
We understand that cost of living (COLA) protection is key to ratifying an agreement. Last month, that message was amplified when 95 per cent of you voted YES in the largest strike vote in our union’s history, giving your bargaining committee an overwhelming strike mandate to stand strong behind our demands. The bottom line is that cost of living protection is required to ensure that our members and their families can catch up and keep up. 
 
As inflation continues to skyrocket – currently reaching 8.1 per cent in B.C. – it erodes workers' spending power. Cost of living protections for wages has become a key issue for all workers, sectors and their unions including the BCGEU. Across the public sector, other unions are engaged in the same fight with similar goals. COLA is a reasonable demand and affordable under the province's fiscal framework. This means that the government will not have to raise taxes to achieve this. MLAs of all parties and minimum wage earners will have wage increases tied to inflation. All workers deserve this.
 
Why is the government’s proposal not acceptable?
 
Simply put, we are not interested in negotiating wage cuts for our members. The government’s current offer on the table is inadequate and shows how out of touch with reality the government is. Anything less than cost-of-living protections is a wage cut. No worker should be expected to take a wage cut. 
 
Your bargaining committee has clearly communicated to government that a signing bonus is not acceptable in this high inflation environment and that it needs to be rolled into a general wage increase that lifts wages into the future. 
 
Our approach to date has been to apply increases on the salary grid retroactive to April 1st of this year to ensure wages match or exceed the rate of inflation in each year of the agreement. The government’s approach seems to be focused on one-time payments, which after taxes, do not provide protections from inflation. We need a collective agreement which meets your needs now and as well as three years from now.
 
Let’s get back to the table
 
**While we were not surprised that your employer decided to go around your bargaining committee to communicate directly to you, we find it deeply disappointing that this government would employ a tactic usually employed by right-wing anti-worker government and employers. This approach by the provincial government effectively undermines the bargaining process.** We appreciate the hundreds of comments and feedback you have given us since yesterday and throughout this process.
 
**We want the government to roll up their sleeves and send their bargaining team back to the table with the mandate to negotiate a fair deal that meets your demands. It’s time to stop playing games.** There is a deal to be had at the table and we want to get to work to achieve it. Thank you for your ongoing support.","front line worker, Service provider ",1,True,2.083333333333333

Hey there, hoping I can get some insight on what the advantages and disadvantages of Victoria are vs Vancouver for a non car owner.  I’m in Vancouver now, looking at moving to Victoria. Only hangup is *how* convenient Vancouver has been without a car. My partner and I would be moving somewhere near downtown in Victoria proper if we make the move, likely to buy a condo as the prices here have become out of control for anything but a tiny shoebox whereas we could get a 2 bedroom there for less than a 1 bedroom here. For reference we are in Mount Pleasant in Vancouver and would like similar density and general walk/bike friendless.  I work from home and she’d likely work at Royal Jubilee hospital somewhere down the road and she doesn't mind a 20-30 minute bike ride to get there.

If we were to make the move, I'm also curious about neighborhoods.  Our main priorities would be proximity to parks, maybe a coffee shop or three, a library nearby and most importantly not along a major arterial multi-lane road with a ton of road noise.   Wouldn't hurt to be and bikeable or walkable to a grocery store. I’ve been a few times to Victoria so I understand the transit isn't *as* good as Vancouver but ideally we wouldn’t even need to rely on it much.  Evo being there is naturally a big draw for the bigger trips.

Long wait, of course, because it's opening day today and the lineup was out the door. But after about an hour, we got a couple 4-piece chicken meals, up-sized the taters and grabbed some mini chicken burgers for later. (2am cold chicken burgers is my happy place. Don't judge.) 

The 4-piece chicken and taters meal is only 13 bucks if you ditch the salad and the drink. Not a fan of coleslaw myself, so this was a no-brainer for me. 

We ended up with an absolute mountain of food. Way too much. But it was fun, and the food was delicious! Hot, slightly greasy, and plentiful, as all fried chicken should be. I made it through 1 piece of chicken, some taters, and 1 mini burger before I was full. Like I said, we ordered way too much food. 

The counter staff seemed a little overwhelmed, but that makes sense for opening day. I did see some mix-ups with people's orders, but most people looked chill about it. (Ours was messed up slightly, as we got extra taters. Sorry to whoever's food we probably ended up with. It went to a good home.)

Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a decent chicken place that isn't overpriced. KFC tastes like dogfood in comparison.

Edit: Leftover cold chicken was 10/10. 😭",Our Place,0,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,Dzzy00,"Looking for more info in regards to communities over the malahat. For a bit of background info, I've lived on the southern-end of the island most of my life. I know very little about the communities north of me. My partner and I want to buy a property with some land in the near future to start a homestead/small farm. We've been keeping an eye on the peninsula market, but we're becoming dubious as to whether or not we'll ever get our foot in the door on a property there. 

We went up to Coombs the other day, and it's absolutely gorgeous up that way and so much farmland. I'm just unsure if I want to be that far removed from everything? Any thoughts on Sooke, Cow Bay, Mill Bay, Coombs ect... would be greatly appreciated.",Community Plan to End Homelessness ,0,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,EHBREW,"GF car got broken into last night. Police called + ICBC claimed. Any advice? Police have started a report/file but it seems like it was homeless people (downtown near Quadra & Fisgard) 
ICBC say they don't cover anything stolen from the car, just the car itself or any accessories. They/he/she stole over $600 worth of stuff (new tent, prescription glasses, etc) 
Looks like there's nothing we can do... Has anyone experienced something similar and somehow either got the stuff back or been financially compensated?? Any advice at all would help. 
Thanks in advance
EDIT: thanks for the replies guys and gals. Looks like it's a sunk cost","Person experiencing homelessness , Tent, Theft",1,False,33.33333333333333
VictoriaBC,EJSpurrell,"Fernwood Writer's Collective Come one, come all, to the Fernwood Writer’s Collective. Open to all lovers of the written word, published or unpublished, poetry or prose. The purpose of the FWC is to provide a local writer’s resource and support group to writers and aspiring authors both young and old.

The invitation is open to all authors within the Greater Victoria area to come down and meet other writers, make connections and help find inspiration and mentoring in a group setting.

This is a new group, with our first meeting taking place at the Cornerstone Café at Gladstone & 
Fernwood on Monday, April 9 at 6:00 PM. We will be introducing ourselves, talking a little bit about our subjective passions as writers, and discussing the direction of future meetings. So come on down, grab a coffee and sit and have a chat with us.

For more information, please contact me here on reddit, or by e-mail at ejspurrell@gmail.com",Peers Victoria Resources Society ,0,False,33.33333333333333
VictoriaBC,EJSpurrell,"Have a Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah & Super Saturnalia, Victoria! From me to you, I hope you enjoy the rest of the holiday season. Drive safe, and if you're going to be drinking, don't drive at all. But if you are going to be drinking, drink as much as it takes to embarrass yourself in front of those closest to you. They're going to need stories for next year.

For the rest of us, the stressful part is nearly over. The world didn't end. Fire didn't rain from the sky. No trumpets were sounded. Extra-dimensional beings/Reticulans/Klingons didn't invade/colonize/harvest our adrenal glands for recreational drugs. The poles didn't shift, and most of the people who actually believed it was going down are either feeling stupid, or pretending they knew it wasn't gonna happen all along. The days are starting to grow longer, and it'll be spring before we know it.

Peace out, Victoria. Give something useful to someone in need. I'm out.",drug use,0,False,100.0

We used to take in our 'soft plastic' and 'flexible plastic packaging' in to the Bottle Depot along with our styrofoam, but they stopped accepting it a few months ago, and ever since we have had a pile of plastic waste building up in our garage. 

I tried taking some of it in to London Drugs a couple of weeks ago, but parking was a nightmare and then the recycling bins inside the store were an utter disaster and overflowing everywhere (presumably because lots of other people are having this same issue). Even Ellice Recycle, which is a paid service, does not take the 'flexible plastic' (things like salad bags, ziplocs etc)

We try to do our best to minimize the quantity of plastic packaging we purchase, but with a 5 person household it inevitably builds up, and is definitely our largest category of household waste. It's really frustrating not to seemingly have any options here, and although it is painful soon I think we're going to have to resort to putting the whole load in the trash.

I am also surprised that given our current council's laser focus on going green and the plastic bag ban, we do not have better curbside recycling options (or, really, ANY options) for plastic recycling-and it doesn't even seem to be an issue that's being discussed?!",drug use,1,False,33.33333333333333

ICBC tells me first, they can help, but when I call to put in the report they say they actually cannot, and suggest the only option is to file a civil lawsuit. Do I have any other options? I'm going to try to summarize only important details.  
My building was working on new balconies, I got asked to move my car. It was put closely under a row of balconies. At some point I realized my custom paint-job was damaged, there were smaller splotches of paint, and debris on my hood as well as in front of my stall. I took pictures.  
I took this to the building manager, who referred me to the construction company. I've been dealing with them by email. Basically they offered to pay $100 initially, but they said that they don't think it was them. I said $100 probably wouldn't be enough. I took it to an auto detailer, He quoted for that damage $357 dlls. Showed this to the construction company they offered $150... I called ICBC for information, the person I spoke with told me they could pursue if requested. And asked me to file an incident report. I did. I sent an email back to construction company, asking that I would be ok with $300 and if that doesn't work, then we'd leave ICBC to figure out as we both disagree on fault. No answer for a week. Called ICBC to file a claim, and was promptly told by the person that they don't have any interest in it as my insurance is basic and they have no monetary gain... I was pretty mad, but even worse, it throws my entire roadmap out the window. 

  
Person from ICBC said the only thing I could do was file a Civil Lawsuit, and that I would have to research online to get a lawyer.  

  
Is this the only thing I can do? can someone give me a basic idea of what a civil lawsuit is? I have never filed one. I have pictures of the damage, it's honestly minimal but it is on my hood, and I have to deal with it or look at it, and I honestly feel the company is responsible for it. in 2 years I've parked my car no issues, the 2 weeks that is there, scratches, paint, and debris.

VictoriaBC,Eblanc88,"Help understanding Issue with tenancy/landlord I live DT on a 2 bedroom apartment with a roomate. My roomate gave notice on sept 25th to leave on end of October. (She didn’t gave me a heads up)

Because I was never on the lease (with landlords knowledge) the rent increased $100 automatically and I had 5 days to complete new lease agreement and find a roomate. I couldn’t find a suitable roomate that quickly. And I had a trip planned for 3 weeks on Oct 9th.

I found a suitable roomate on Oct 5th, showed him the place, and he paid rent and damage deposit. Since I was the lease owner/responsible I didn’t thought he needed to sign the lease. I did let me landlord know and offer him to meet the new tenant at least twice before I left but never heard back from him.

Here is my first mistake. Becase new roomate paid in advance he wanted a receipt, I wrote a lease agreement, didn’t thought much of it. 

On Oct 16th the roomate that was leaving went to clean up and collect damage deposit. She was supossed to hand the keys to new roomate and get paid for half october rent from
New roomate as they both coordinated so that he could  move in early. But rhe landlord took keys from her. Saying he jeeded them for the damage deposit. After that he did not want to give them to the new roomate. Because he wasn’t on the lease. 

Roomate sent a copy of the lease agreement i wrote. Landlord got upset, all this while I’m in Mexico. There was a lot of back and forth over long distance calls so that I could try sort things out. Not have to pay for full rent on a 2 bdr apartment. But nothing panned out

The landlord didn’t provide any option other than me mailing my keys (he said he was legally bind and apologized) my new roomate got frustrated and asked for a refund. Landlord didn’t like he didn’t have a job (even though he had savings and personal business)

Landlord offered to show the place to people if I gave his number. I put up an ad again. Found another suitable candidate.

Gave him the landlords phone but my landlord kept avoiding him, saying no. He was upset

Guy looks respectable, has steady job, age 35. 


I cut my trip short I’m at the airport. The whole thing is confusing to me and its been really stressful. 

I’m gonna talk to my landlord but need more information.

1. Why my ex roomate was ok having a roomate without a lease and I am not? 

2. My writting a lease agreement I got told it could be grounds for eviction. Can it they still use that even though that roomate didn’t stay? I would think it gets cancelled

3. If my landlord was just being a jerk, do I have any recourse/support? He has said to me “I decide who stays, I look at them and if they look like a drug dealer I don’t have to let them in”

4. There is a claise on my tenancy agreement. What does this mean exactly: 17. ASSIGN OR SUBLET. The Tenant may assign or sublet the rental unit to another person with the written consent of the Landlord. If this tenancy agreement is for a fixed length of 6 months or more, the Landlord must not unreasonably withhold consent. Under an assignment a new Tenant must assume all of the rights and obligations under the existing tenancy agreement, at the same rent. The Landlord must not charge a fee or receive a benefit, directly or indirectly, for giving this consent. If a Landlord unreasonably withholds consent to assign or sublet or charges a fee, the Tenant may apply for arbitration under the Act.

5. Any other information that would be important or useful to know?

I’m extremely dumb when it comes to bureaucracy, tenancy agreements. I’m also dealing with a lot of external stress (not just this) so I’m having a uard time thinking objectively.

VictoriaBC,Edores,"Just moved here, lived in a town of about 15,000 for over a decade - I'm overwhelmed (In a good way!) So I've never really lived in a big city center, and until a few days ago I lived in Terrace, BC, which is in the middle of nowhere way up north and has a pretty scant population. I'm used to being able to bike from one point to another in about 10 minutes max, amd having nothing to do, ever. Things like public transportation and having more stores available to me in one mall than I had in a 10 mile radius are pretty mindboggling.

Most of my time is spent trying to get more settled and find an apartment/job, but it's getting to the point where I can start exploring the city more and doing fun things. Unfortunately my bike won't be arriving for a couple of weeks, and until I get financially situated I don't have a ton of money, but I don't think that's going to be too much of an issue when there's just so much stuff around.

So some questions for you guys:

* What are some cool/fun things to do/see that I probably have no idea even exist, keeping in mind I've visited a big city once or twice in the last decade.
* What's the best way to learn how to work all the public transport? Most people I know in big cities always seem to know exactly when to use a bus, a cab, which ones to get on, stuff like that. There might be other options I don't even know exist - when I went down to San Francisco I discovered the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which is something I wouldn't have known to look for if a friend hadn't told me.
* Anything I should know specifically about big city life? I know it's kind of a general question, but hey. I'm sure someone has had a similar experience and found surprises (good or bad) that can be shared with the inexperienced.

Additionally, what are some decent ways to meet people around here? I'm fairly young (22) and I thought it would be pretty easy, and maybe it will be once I find a job and just start finding the interesting things here I like to do a lot. But I'm finding people talk to each other a little less than in a small town where everyone kind of knows everyone. I should probably start looking around for meetups and things like that, which is something that just wasn't really going on in my previous place.

Anyway, thanks for anything you guys can throw my way! I'm enjoying it here so far.","Lived Experience, People with lived experience, Point in Time",0,False,0.0

VictoriaBC,EththeEth,"Thanks from England Hiya folks.

I’m a Canadian/American born in New Westminster on the mainland, but my family resides in Victoria. I’ve lived in England since I was three, and visited every other year. Victoria is by far one of my favourite places in the world, but this year it was different, and not for the obvious reasons themselves, such as COVID.

I travelled back to Victoria this summer in early June when my grandfather’s heart condition significantly deteriorated. As we were finalising our tickets for the next week, he passed away. My Grandmother was moving out of the care home where they resided, and needed us to come back urgently to help with the move as my Uncle, the father to my cousin, a teenage boy named Darwyn with an enlarged heart, stage 3 autism and Down Syndrome was busy notifying family and friends, including my Grandfather’s younger sisters in Toronto, who are still distraught and unwilling to talk to anyone today.

During my initial 2 week quarantine in Victoria, the delivery men and women who brought us our takeout meals and grocery deliveries were always caring and understanding. Once I got out and attended my grandfather’s funeral 3 weeks after his death, we helped my grandmother move into her new apartment. The movers and care home staff, as well as the building administrators were all very helpful. I spent 3 weeks with family seeing the sights and hanging out around the city. I didn’t get to do the things I had always done, like visit the BC museum’s awesome imax theatre, go on the harbour ferry or hang out at the pier watching Harbour Air flights arrive and depart, but the scenery around James Bay was a great addition to my daily walks, and not once did I encounter anyone rude or unwelcoming throughout my trip.

Victoria provided an easy setting for my grandfathers passing and the mourning of my family. It gave us all we needed and more. It allowed me to be with my uncle and aunt more, who are awesome people, and to be with my grandmother, who was finally finding some freedom, independence and comfort again after losing her husband, who had suffered for some time. I got to go to Murchies tea room with her as well, something I did with my grandparents every time I visited.

A few days after I got back to London, sitting in my living room at home, I saw my cousin Darwyn for the last time on a FaceTime call with my Uncle. Considering he can’t talk, has problems with even the slightest change in his routine, is a survivor of several open heart surgeries and should not have lived into teenage years according to his Doctors, I was truly touched when my uncle showed me to him on the phone, and he smiled, repeatedly waving to me for several minutes before he decided he wanted to continue his routine. 

Since I read him his favourite book a few years ago he continued to recognise me, something he doesn’t do with too many people. Apparently when my Grandmother mentioned my name in a song she sung for him in his routine with her, he would always start smiling, then continue his activity. While I was looking forwards to continued interaction with him, the next four days after that call was nothing but pain for us all, particularly my uncle, aunt and my other cousin; his older sister. He began expelling blood any way his body could: vomiting blood, urinating it, blood in his stool, and he was in constant pain as his heart began grinding to a steady halt. Four days later, as he lay asleep in his most comfortable position in the corner of his bed, he too passed away just around a month after his grandfather, with whom he shared a special bond that none of us will truly be able to comprehend. 

They are now buried alongside each other just outside Victoria. Since then, my Uncle write an article called “Dying in pandemic times”, which was published over a week ago in the times colonist, detailing the experiences above from his point of view. I wanted to say thank you to Victoria for the comfort it provided me and my family during these 5 weeks of change and tragedy in my family. It will always be a special place to me, and I’m thankful to the people of Victoria who helped my family bury my grandfather and move my grandmother. A fair few people apparently knew of Darwyn, and the support my family received when he passed away was very helpful.

Thanks guys. You’re a great bunch of folks.","Lived Experience, Point in Time",0,True,28.57142857142857

I was on waitlist for surgery with a specialist in Toronto for 2.5 years before having to make the move to Victoria. I am still on the waitlist (now almost 3 years in) and they are ready to start talking about dates.

VictoriaBC,First_Plastic_2763,"Hudson Mews / Townline Rentals Reviews Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

Hoping to see if any of you have experience renting at the Hudson Mews and specifically since Townline took over as the building manager?

&#x200B;

I'm currently looking for a new rental and came across the Hudson Mews building. I work downtown and am looking to get a large dog in the next year so the Hudson buildings seem to be an obvious choice (aka one of the only choices). I'm used to living downtown so I'm prepared for all the typical downsides (loud, busy, construction, etc.) but what I'm hesitant about is the management company.  I looked on Google and the reviews are pretty lackluster and make me feel like I'm guaranteed to lose my damage deposit at move out and just generally have to deal with bad management. However, it looks like Townline has started managing these units recently instead of Pearson (which I think still rents the other Hudson buildings), so I'm wondering if things may have changed with the switch?

&#x200B;

If any of you have any experience or have heard about the building or the rental group, I'd love to hear your thoughts before I possibly sign up to lose $2k!

VictoriaBC,FrcknFrckn,"Victoria council approves Truth Centre residential development (copied from the Times Colonist)

Victoria council has approved Abstract Development’s plans to transform the former Fort Street Truth Centre, 1201 Fort, into an 83-unit residential development.

Council voted Thursday night to approve the rezoning after a public hearing that stretched over two days and saw about 100 people take the mic.

The project will see 83 units including nine in townhouses along Pentrelew Place and the balance in a four-storey and a six-storey condominium built on the two-acre lot.

Abstract said the project went through six revisions after extensive consultation with the neighbourhood.


But opposition to the project, especially from those living immediately adjacent who felt the proposal was too dense, was strong. Critics felt it was too dense for the residential Rockland neighbourhood and that six-storey condos were out of character with the Fort Street heritage corridor.

Plans call for 58 per cent of the two-acre lot to remain as open space. Eight mature Garry oaks and 14 other mature trees will be retained and 83 new trees planted.

It also calls for a public walkway — an extension of the Pemberton Trail — to run through the site.

About two thirds of the people who spoke at the hearing were in support, with many saying it would provide much-needed housing within walking distance of downtown.

While the project itself has no affordable units, Abstract has committed to provide 10 below-market units (five for low income and five for moderate income) in another project it has planned at 1010 Fort St.

Abstract has named the project Bellewood Park. Pre-sales will open this spring.

I'm Fred Haynes, candidate for Mayor of Saanich.

Four years ago, running, for council I had an AMA here. I am back for more.

&#x200B;

I am running for mayor because Saanich needs to be a place for future generation to live work and play. Lets achieve this. You can see my platform, background and policy pieces on my website [here](https://www.fredhaynes.ca/) or for more updated content see my Facebook page [here](https://www.facebook.com/FredHaynes4SaanichMayor/).

&#x200B;

If elected I will carry on working for more housing, more daycare, improved road safety, reduced congestion, protecting green space, a new ice hockey facility, expanded commercial tax base to take pressure off residential taxes, fiscal efficiency, revitalizing rural Saanich farms, and more. Together, lets expect more.

&#x200B;

We need to with the provincial and federal government to tackle issues. The big ones are Housing, Transportation, Family issues and the Environment.

&#x200B;

My experience this past four years with Council has been positive and productive. Council has managed to accomplish many great things in the past four years. I believe the role of the Mayor is to help lead Council and Saanich in a clear path for the future. I have a proven record to show can provide this leadership.

&#x200B;

There has been multiple all candidate debates, radio & news paper interviews and interest group questionnaires. However it is easy to get lost amongst all the different sources of information. If there are any points or issues you want a deeper answer on from me join us on Reddit. If you want a question me on my experience as a teacher,  diabetes researcher, a parent or small business owner please feel free to dig into those less traveled areas.

I will start replying to you Saturday Oct 13th starting at 10:00am for an hour or two.

I will then work to return on a regular basis until the end of the election on the 20th to follow up on more questions.

We’ve been trying to Google the place, but it’s difficult to find anything about Victoria that isn’t aimed at either tourists or retired baby boomers. 

We’re both professionals in our mid-30s. We currently live in Halifax, but we both spent the bulk of our adult lives as Montrealers, and that city is our gold standard for fun cities. We like Halifax okay (we knew we were moving to a much smaller place), but weren’t prepared to be living in the city with the worst weather in the country, so Victoria’s weather is obviously the big plus sign we’re seeing right now. 

Victoria obviously isn’t Montreal, but how does it compare to Halifax? I’ve read a bunch of touristy things about great food, etc, in Victoria, but I’ve seen people complaining in this sub about how there are no good restaurants. Is that for real, or is it just standard reddit bellyaching?

Are there things for youngish people like us to do? Are there pub trivia nights, summer softball leagues, artsy fartsy movie theatres and stuff like that, or is the city as sleepy and retirement-themed as its reputation? Would we be in a demographic dead zone between the students and the retirees? That’s kind of the impression I get from lurking on this sub.

My girlfriend and I, 23 and 25 respectively, are moving to Victoria in May 2020.  Currently, we own a home in London, Ontario just a couple hours West of Toronto.  I have lived here my entire life and my girlfriend has as well (with a brief one-year period in Edmonton).  We are planning to start new lives in Victoria - having both of us visited multiple times, we really have fallen in love with all of Vancouver Island; not excluding Victoria.  

The both of us really enjoy the outdoors and really look forward to not having to travel so far to spend time outside.  Hiking, walking our Border Collie, mountain biking, fishing, etc.  From where we currently live, it is a distance to get the stimulation we look for in the outdoors from the current landscape of Southwestern Ontario.  That, among wanting a more socially laid back community and less Toronto hustle; we have sought Victoria as our next place to live.

Of course we can't just keep up our lifestyle without working for it.  For myself, I am a Financial Advisor/Planner.  I have been running my own independent financial firm since I was 18 years old.  While seeking new clients/investors is challenging in many landscapes; I really look forward to bringing my expertise and what I have to offer to the Island.  It is much different in terms of economics (I've researched and created business plans for Victoria) but I am confident that my profession always has a place anywhere and I have clients throughout Canada so it is not dependent on where I live.

My girlfriend is finishing up school and completing her Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation.  She has multiple opportunities to pursue her career in Victoria including the Public sector that should be fruitious for her.  My business should prove sufficient for the both of us until she is able to get into her new job.

We are confident that the social parameters that have been set by much of the reviews online will be something we can break past easily, as we are both socially engaged people.  My girlfriend also has a cousin who lives there and I have a couple of friends in Campbell River and Duncan.  The issue of not being able to find friends does not seem to bother us; we are confident that we will put ourselves in position to make new friends (and face embarrassment a couple of times)!

**The main reason for this post today is not to give Reddit my life story but to establish what buildings are going up now that are going to be for rent in June - August 2020 (would also consider section of renovated home).**  

We have booked and paid for our 2.5 month Airbnb in Langford for June - August.  We are selling our home here in London and plan for it to close on the 15th of May; then we will begin the RV across Canada arriving in Victoria on June 1st, 2020.  We will then spend next summer trying to meet landlords and lock down a place that meets our needs/wants.  Our maximum budget is $2,400.00 per month and we are wanting to rent for 2-4 years before purchasing another home; leasing arrangements are fine with us.  We also have a dog and cat.

What should we expect for a two-bedroom?  We are okay living as far as Langford (aware of traffic) or Sidney but we do not want to compromise on having a nice place!  We want to ensure we get a fairly modern rental.

We've decided on a date/time of ***Thursday the 16th, 6:30-8pm***; if anyone else wants to join / knows someone who'd like to join, you should give us a shout here.  (You could also just drop by...)

I'd like this to happen at a place with some wind/sun shelter (plus contingency plans for rain), and it should have the public readily available (so we can give balloons away!)  I propose meeting up at Cook St. Village, say, outside the Mocha House, and ask permission from one of the coffeehouses to do it at their outdoors balcony (it squeaks and all).  Let me know if other locales is preferred.

I'll bring the balloons, 2 pumps, and the rest of the kit.  We'll learn some handling tips, and follow with several of the fundamental twists (lock, pinch/pop, tulip); at the end you will be able to make a variety of four-legged animals (dogs, cats, bunnies...), teddy bears *con fiori*, chile *con carne*, and some hats (possibly the hat I made for Ing at a previous meetup).

* What you'd need to do before the day:

  1. If you have non-short nails, you will need to clip them, preferably earlier than Tuesday.  Both long and freshly cut nails don't go well with balloons.   
  2. Wriggle the pinky + ring finger of your off-hand.  Wriggle wriggle.  I'm serious!  Keep doing it.  Hold a pen with 'em.  Open beer bottles.  (*Ahem*.  The last one was just for the lulz.)
  3. If you have access to a color-printer, let me know - I'll send along a few pages for use at the session.
  4. Let me know if there are other things you'd like to learn.

VictoriaBC,GeoffdeRuiter,"My neighbour missed out on $5,000 worth of rebates because of wrong information by the installer. Here is your ultimate guide to heat pump rebates in the CRD (and mainly applicable to the rest of BC). Rebates for *replacing your existing fossil fuel heating system* can be up to $11,000 (or possibly up to $16,500, see below) for a system that could range in price from $15,000 to $20,000+, depending on brands, other install needs, and sizes (I am sorry for the recent installer inflated prices). My neighbour did not know about the federal program at all and the installer already installed the heat pump, so made it ineligible. The installer should have done a better job coaching them, and thus my reason for putting this email together.

&#x200B;

**There are 4 rebates sources you can tap into:**

1. [Canada Greener Homes Grant](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy-efficiency/homes/canada-greener-homes-grant/start-your-energy-efficient-retrofits/plan-document-and-complete-your-home-retrofits/eligible-grants-for-my-home-retrofit/23504#s5) for up to $5,000.
2. Jointly administered [Clean BC](https://betterhomesbc.ca/about-us/) ([Search tool](https://betterhomesbc.ca/rebate-search-tool/)) / [BC Hydro](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/residential/rebates-programs/home-renovation/renovating-heating-system/fuel-switching.html) rebates from the Province (#1 Up to $6,000 heat pump; #2 possible $500 electrical service upgrade. +Additional Income Qualifying Rebates up to [$9,500 heat pump](https://betterhomesbc.ca/rebates/cleanbc-income-qualified-heat-pumps/); #2 possible [$3,500 electrical service upgrade](https://betterhomesbc.ca/rebates/cleanbc-income-qualified-electrical-service-upgrade/)).
3. [Municipal heat pump top up rebates](https://betterhomesbc.ca/municipal-offers/) (Victoria offers $2,000; Saanich, Colwood, View Royal, and Sydney $350, Langford currently $0).
4. [Clean BC Group Purchase Rebate](https://betterhomesbc.ca/rebates/gpr/) ([In the CRD you can join the CRD generated group with their code](https://www.crd.bc.ca/education/climate-action/reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions/buildings/rebates-retrofits)).

&#x200B;

**Here is your list of steps to getting the full rebates:**

1. It all starts with the application to the Canada Greener Homes Grant. [The steps for this process can be found here](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy-efficiency/homes/canada-greener-homes-grant/start-your-energy-efficient-retrofits/23443#G1). But in short, #1 Learn about the grants✅, #2 Register and book your pre-retrofit EnerGuide evaluation (and wait to receive approval), #3 *^((Collect Group Purchase Code and register code to your address. See Point 2 below))**,* Plan, get quotes, document and complete your home retrofits, #4 Book your post-retrofit EnerGuide evaluation and apply for the grant ^((along with applying for the reset of the rebates through BC Hydro portal. See Point 3 below)), #5 Receive your grant.
2. The [Clean BC Group Purchase rebate ""How to Apply""](https://betterhomesbc.ca/rebates/gpr/) lays out the setup process, but in the CRD you will use [the code graciously generated every three months by the CRD](https://www.crd.bc.ca/education/climate-action/reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions/buildings/rebates-retrofits).
3. Once your heat pump is installed, use the same [BC Hydro online portal](https://app.bchydro.com/hero) to apply for all your BC rebates at once (Clean BC, Municipal top up, and Group Purchase rebates).
4. Spread the news of your successes about all the rebates you got and link to this post for others to use, if you haven't done so already.

&#x200B;

**Key additional notes:**

* When getting quotes, tell the company you are also receiving 3 other quotes, they need to know or think they are competing, even if you don't end up getting other quotes.
* Some larger ""4 tonne"", and perhaps low efficiency, heat pumps do not qualify for rebates. If you have around a 3,000 sq ft house, search for Fujitsu or [Mitsubishi installers](https://www.mitsubishielectric.ca/en/hvac), some of their larger units do qualify. Your installer should know what units qualify by now, or [you can search the Canada Greener Homes Grant list](https://oee.nrcan.gc.ca/pml-lmp/index.cfm?language_langue=en&action=app.search-recherche&appliance=ASHP1_GH).
* IMO the better brands for central forced air heat pumps are Fujitsu, Mitsubishi, Samsung, and Daikin, but there are many other brands that will work very well too, and perhaps be a tiny more affordable.
* Ask to make sure that the heat pump you buy will run on heat pump mode the vast majority of the year. Electric resistive backup can really add up for electricity, and so you want a heat pump that will be on heat pump mode as much as possible in our climate, rather than one that has a smaller overall capacity and will switch to or supplement with electric backup at say 0 degrees. Heat pumps are commonly designed to work down to -20C and even -30C these days, but have lower capacities at those temps. As long as the unit covers your full house needs at -5C, you could be good to go and not have to think about backup heat kicking on. Most heat pumps can easily cover your needs in our coastal climate if sized to, mostly in the southern interior (occasional backup), and north (with common backup heat in the coldest parts of winter).
* I won't list or recommend any specific company ^((unless one wants to pay me $100,000 to do so!)), but the companies that only offer sales of heat pumps and don't deal with gas installations anymore are usually better at knowing, caring about, and installing heat pumps. People that install gas systems still like installing or suggesting to stay with gas. Time to move on!

&#x200B;

Also if you want more information on heat pumps I am the mod for r/HeatPumps (and former group purchase organizer and installer). At r/HeatPumps you can [find information packages](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nu_n7n8pYvlbt67sxGYp9bmpZCxulYAK?usp=sharing) to learn everything you need to know to buy a good heat pump, get advice from others, share pictures and stories of your install, and [enter and see quotes from other people](https://www.reddit.com/r/heatpumps/comments/raocha/heat_pump_quote_comparison_survey_this_is_a/).

If you have any questions, I can try answer them, but I won't be defending the technology to naysayers, and no one else should either. It's time to charge forward into the future and not look back! 🛸 The technology is long proven for our climates and highly capable for houses of all sizes. **Get those rebates for climate action** ***and*** **coool summer AC!**","Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , BC Housing, Community Plan to End Homelessness , Low income, Low-income, Peer Housing Support Program, Point in Time",1,False,0.0

Full Elliot story: In the late fall we noticed he was pretty badly beat up on his back and the tip of his tail was gone. We fed him as much as he came by and provided an outside dry place for him. Eventually we helped trap him inside the house and then helped bring him to Animal Control Services. He was always really friendly and affectionate, but guarded his back because of his injuries. He nicely interacted with our cat, and it seemed they were friends. If we had a larger house (condo) we would likely adopt Elliot but that is not in the cards.

Yes maybe Langford is more affordable for apartments but I don't understand why they think we would want to live in a 75-household massive stand-alone apartment building that requires us to drive for every need. Most people who choose to live in apartments do so because they favour the convenience, but without amenities nearby there is no convenience.

City planners in Langford have the opportunity to build an entire city with all the modern knowledge of what people want (walkability, community centres, convenience without needing to drive) and instead are planning like it's 1980.

> “It’s miraculous no one was hurt,” said Bowen Osoko, acting spokesman for the Victoria Police Department.

> Police said the man had been in the truck outside his Green Street residence, near Royal Athletic Park, about 8 a.m. when he realized he had forgotten something. He returned to the home and left his motor running.

> While inside, he heard the truck moving out of the driveway and went outside to see the vehicle being driven away. He then saw two reserve constables on foot patrol and asked for help.

> The reserve constables called in the stolen truck and a description of the suspect before police officers arrived to take the victim’s report.

> As officers searched for the truck, the victim and his partner looked around the neighbourhood and came across the vehicle a few blocks away on Mason Street.

> The victim approached a man outside the truck sorting through tools that had been inside of it. He then saw another man with some of his property, but when he went to speak with him, the first man hopped in the truck and began to drive away.

> At that point, the victim hurried toward his truck and made a grab for it.

> The victim’s partner followed in her vehicle, and along the way the victim yelled at people for help and several 911 calls were made.

> The suspect finally slowed down the truck and jumped out while it was still moving at the corner at Bay and Blanshard streets.

> The victim, by that time in the truck bed, was able to climb to the cab and put the brakes on.

It is also easier to go to this clinic where they can follow your entire sexual health history if you do not have a family doctor. Along with both of those things, they educate students and anybody who asks about sexual health.

This morning, I shared this statement with council. “I would like to take this opportunity to address my decision to travel to Somalia over the holidays, and the concerns that have been raised by my fellow councillors and our constituents over the past several days, following the release of my public statement last week.Let’s get to the heart of the matter. By travelling to see my family, at a time when so many others in our community did not do the same, I let you down. The decision I made to travel last month - against the advice of public health - was wrong, and I am sorry.Each of us has a unique story, and is missing family members right now. Victorians have made incredible sacrifices in order to protect ourselves, our families and our neighbours from the deadly COVID-19 virus. I also know that many people have lost family during this time. The global pandemic is a challenge facing every community worldwide, and until vaccines are available in all countries, we are all affected - but we are not all affected equally. When I made the choice to travel to Somalia and Kenya, I considered my travel to be essential. I went to Somalia and Kenya to support my family members with their personal and economic well-being, and to try to provide additional support to them during this very difficult time.As many of you know, I fled Somalia in 1992 at the age of eight, because of civil war. Over the past 28 years, my immediate and extended families have continued to face conflict and uncertainty. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, my family depended on me for financial help. The impacts of the pandemic on my family, extended families and their communities have only made their circumstances more difficult. I didn’t want to wait for the end of the pandemic, and hope that my family would still be alive. And yet, I know there are many Victorians and Islanders who haven’t seen their loved ones - many of whom are living with considerable hardships and are vulnerable to COVID-19 - for months or even longer. My desire to see my family was not unique. However, in choosing to travel at this time, I made the wrong choice. My family needs my care and compassion, but like many others, I need to find other ways to provide that care and support, until we can be together in person again. I want to apologize to each of my colleagues directly. Many of you have received calls, emails and messages from constituents about my decision to travel; it has added to your workloads, and I regret that my actions have been a distraction from the important work the city is doing. I should have shared my plans with my colleagues on Council, and provided you with more background about my travel plans, and my motivation for doing so. This was a mistake on my part.Some may be concerned that I may be putting Victorians at risk by returning to the Island, after two weeks in quarantine in Vancouver. I want to assure my colleagues, all all Islanders, that I’ve followed all public health rules and guidelines for returning travellers, and have also taken additional COVID tests to make sure I do not endanger the health of anyone upon my return home. Since I was elected in 2018, I’ve devoted my energy, time, compassion, care, and hard work to my constituents in this region. This is an honour and a privilege to be a member of this Council, and I look forward to continuing to contribute to this community. In choosing to travel over the holidays, I’ve caused you to question your confidence in me, and I’ve lost your trust. Over the coming weeks and months, I’ll be working hard to earn that trust back. I will be focusing all of my energy on the important work of helping the residents of Victoria as we navigate through this pandemic, and take on the critical task of ensuring a just recovery for our community - one that includes creating a more welcoming Victoria, building strong neighborhoods, and supporting each other. Thank you for your time.

VictoriaBC,HaveAGoodDayEh,"Victoria man 'terrorized' common-law partner daily for six months [Times Colonist] [https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/victoria-man-terrorized-common-law-partner-daily-for-six-months-1.24209564](https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/victoria-man-terrorized-common-law-partner-daily-for-six-months-1.24209564)

 A Beacon Hill Park camper choked, suffocated and strangled his common-law partner almost every day for six months, in a campaign of violence that left her “bruised, battered and emotionally destroyed.”

That information was revealed Thursday at Joshua Miller’s sentencing hearing in Victoria provincial court. The 35-year-old homeless man pleaded guilty to assaulting the victim from Jan. 1 to July 12, 2020, and threatening to kill her during the same time period.

“The facts are truly horrendous,” said provincial court Judge Mayland McKimm as he sentenced Miller to nine months in jail, followed by three years of probation.

“On a daily basis, Mr. Miller would threaten, terrorize and assault the victim and, by his own admission, committed acts of violence that were atrocious and disgusting.”

Crown prosecutor Paul Pearson told the court that Miller had been in a relationship with the woman, whose identity is protected by a court order, since 2018. Before she met him, the victim had a job and money in her bank account. Their relationship was fraught with conflict and violence, and she ended up living with Miller in a tent in Beacon Hill Park from early 2020 into the summer.

Almost every day, Miller would assault her, putting the weight of his body on hers, his hands around her throat, and strangling her, said Pearson. Twice, she lost control of her bladder and almost lost consciousness.

“He would not stop strangling her, even when she screamed for help,” said Pearson. “She had bruises all over the body … Every day, he would grab her by the side of the throat or put his fist up to the side of her head and use his fist to dig into her face or her body to hurt her.”

When she tried to phone police, Miller would stop her, he said.

The couple was provided housing in the Travelodge at 123 Gorge Rd. East, one of the hotels leased by the province as emergency housing for people living in homeless encampments.

But the assaults continued — there were so many complaints about Miller’s abuse of the victim that he was barred from the building, said Pearson. That didn’t stop Miller, who continued to come into the building and physically assault and threaten the victim, the prosecutor said.

Victoria police became aware of the situation and began to investigate. The victim gave a statement to police, then recanted after being pressured by Miller. After he was arrested, she confirmed her original statement.

Miller came from an abusive background, said Pearson. His father abused him and he was sexually abused by another adult. He left home at 12, and had been working at The Keg, but said he left that job to devote more time to the victim.

Miller saw himself as a leader and provider for many in the homeless community during the pandemic, but he was heavily addicted to alcohol and using street narcotics on a regular basis. When he drank, he would lose control and his behaviour would escalate, said Pearson.

“It’s certainly concerning that he has no ability to control his level of violence.”

Defence lawyer Stephen Suntock, who has represented Miller since 2014, said his client understands the “outrageous” nature of his behaviour. “When he came into custody, he indicated he did not wish to seek bail and would be pleading guilty. He was sickened by what he had done to \[the victim\] and is genuinely remorseful for his behaviour.”

Substance abuse underlies all Miller’s violent behaviour, said Suntock.

In her victim impact statement, the young woman told the judge Miller’s physical, emotional and mental abuse made her question her own sanity, saying he told her repeatedly that she was crazy.

She said she continues to be terrified that he will try to find her and kill her. “It got to the point where Josh was strangling me daily. I would beg for my life and he would respond that he was going to make sure I died,” she said. “I have no reason to believe he won’t try to hurt me.”

The accused told the judge he would leave Vancouver Island and never contact the victim again.

McKimm said Miller’s serious history of violence is an aggravating factor in the case — of his 12 prior convictions for assault, all but two involve intimate partners. But the judge noted that the accused has accepted responsibility for his actions.

“His remorse is as genuine as the terror he inflicted,” he said.

McKimm reluctantly accepted a joint submission from the Crown and defence of a nine-month sentence, saying a sentence of 12 to 18 months would be more appropriate.

During his probation, Miller must have no contact with the victim or her family, or be anywhere on Vancouver Island south of the Malahat. He is not allowed to use drugs or alcohol and must obey a curfew of 9 p.m to 6 a.m. for the first year, even if he is in a tent.

He must not enter into or continue any relationship until his partner has been told by his probation officer about his convictions.

Miller is required to take counselling and treatment for anger management, violence prevention, alcohol or drug abuse, spousal abuse prevention and mental health, and must attend forensic psychiatric services, as directed by his probation officer.

McKimm also imposed a lifetime weapons and firearms prohibition.

VictoriaBC,HeadHealthy,"Need inputs from Victorians about living near Pandora Ave My family (me, my wife, and our 2 year old daughter) will be moving to Victoria this fall and I found this available apartment near Pandora Ave at relatively close proximity to Our Place Society. While the possibility of living near downtown excites us if we get to live in this apartment, I also probably have unfounded hesitancy due to high concentration of homeless tents along Pandora. Would you recommend living in this area with a toddler? Is this neighborhood relatively safe? I very much appreciate your advice.

EDIT: Thank you very much for all your inputs and advices. I just want to say that you are all very helpful and wonderful human beings. This is my very first reddit post and it was such a positive experience getting so many replies. I hope to return the favor in this subreddit once our family have settled in Victoria and I have better perspective from that ground. 

Overall, I think there is a consensus in the replies that the area is not the best place for raising a toddler. Personally, I am pretty unfazed by homelessness having seen much in Vancouver, San Francisco, and Portland but I agree with many of you that it is something I would rather not see on a daily basis. My wife and my kid will probably have low tolerance too.

July 12 & 13th -Visited Donostia University Hospital in Donostia-San Sebastien 


July 14th - Reported bag missing with San Sebastien Local Police (who recommended he replace his passport at the Embassy in Madrid)


July 15th - Visited La Paz Hospital in Madrid (unconfirmed whether he was able to receive his medication)


July 15th - Went to Canadian Embassy in Madrid to apply for a new passport (This was the last place he was seen)


July 18th - Did not show up for appointment to complete passport application at the Embassy

As individuals we have to choose where to live based on many factors, including what we can afford and the cost of living.

VictoriaBC,HotterRod,"Political Goals of Tent Cities Explained [Posted by Ashley Molli on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10156277813350412&id=516100411):

> On Friday, the judge threw the book at us. Not only did he chose to displace Camp Namegans with 4 days notice, he chose to add a police enforcement order meaning that cops can go in and arrest anyone still there Tuesday night at 7pm. I spent yesterday crying and reflecting. In Joshua's words, in moments of catastrophic loss and set back, it's important to take a step back and look at what has been accomplished in the tent cities movement.

> In the cities in BC where there are organized tent cities, people are no longer experiencing individualized homelessness. Daily displacement, moving from one park to another with your worldy belongings on your back, is no longer acceptable for people. It will be met with resistance.

> This movement has shifted the conversation about homelessness as an individual and moral failing to one of housing affordability, availability, and access. Importantly, tent cities have started conversations about the appropriateness of shelters and supportive housing. With slogans such as ""shelters are not homes"" tent city residents have raised the bar as to what can be considered a home. We have drawn attention to housing and shelter policies that kill people. For instance, guest policies that leave people isolated in their rooms to overdose and die. Or policies that mean couples can't sleep in the same room. People are challenging and no longer willing to sacrifice their rights to get housing.

> Tent cities have illuminated a strong deserving/undeserving discourse that has always been under the surface. Tent cities are full of people who are highly criminalized - a segment of the homeless population who may have money to pay rent, but get so severely judged when they show up to view a rental unit, those who will always get overlooked. These are the same folks who are banned from shelters and low income housing, and are often further criminalized when accessing services. An endless cycle from jail to street. In tent cities, they are thriving, they are making meaning and building community, learning new ways of being and dealing with conflict, making steps to move away from violent pasts. This is transformative work.

> While this court decision was a surprise, it can be explained. In tent cities, homeless people are no longer homeless. Tent cities put into question everything we think about homeless people - that they are incapable of running their homes and lives, that they are some distinctive population that is in need of different treatment than the rest of society. Because people are running their own homes and lives without money, tent cities challenge an entire system of homeless management. Tent cities put into question property rights, home ownership, and paying rent. They challenge the very notion of private property on which our entire legal system is based on.","Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , BC Housing, Community Plan to End Homelessness , Homeless, Homelessness , Low income, Low-income, Makola Housing Society , Overdose/overdosed , Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, Person experiencing homelessness , Shelter, Social Housing , Social problem , Sooke Transition House Society, Tent",0,True,0.0

> **Victoria at last has council it deserves**

> Victoria finally has the city council we deserve. Ben Isitt, Jeremy Loveday and Together Victoria have a mandate, and progressive values demand that they follow through on their promises:

> Build 10,000 new affordable homes and rental-only homes in the city. Make the fat-cat developers sell half of any new buildings as affordable housing. As Isitt said, we need a “massive expansion of decommodified, state-owned and state-supported housing.”

> Stop catering to car drivers, put the bike lanes down Cook Street where they promised. Support homeless camping in city parks until permanent shelters are built.

> Help reconciliation with Isitt’s idea to rename Victoria to Camosack. Ensure that the statue of colonizer Sir John A. Macdonald never sees the light of day.

> It’s time to make good on Isitt’s promise to open the public treasury for the common good. Push forward on his plan for a municipal income tax. Cut the police budget and reallocate that money to social justice.

VictoriaBC,Ialmostthewholepost,"My dog was attacked by a pitbull mix in Saanich - Looking for some advice on what to do next Hey VictoriaBC,

I was out for a walk with my dogs on Friday night, and had the hankering for some McDonalds.  I walked past a guy who was attending to random items in the back of his truck when I heard a **THUMPASCRATCHTHUMPATHUMPA** followed by a frantic, ""GET YOUR DOGS UP!!"".  

Turns out the windows on the truck were half open and there was an aggressive dog in cab, who jumped out and as soon as it hit the ground grabbed my smaller dog in its mouth (I have two very well trained Boston Terrier - Pugg crosses, he chose the 20lb female instead of my 30lb male).  I honestly don't remember the first 3 to 5 seconds, but from witnesses and the dogs owners, I basically collapsed on the 100lb Pit, threw it in a chokehold with it's face next to mine as it still held my dog.  First thing I knew I was on the ground, my right upper flank pressed into its chest, and I was throwing down my first ever ""I want to choke the everliving shitfuck out of you until you don't move ever again"" chokehold.  

I got its head up into the air so that the guy could try to extract my dog from its mouth, and he got bit in the process.  The lady who owned the dog ran out of the McDonalds as she heard my dog yelping and me going for a psychological win in the addition to the choking action by yelling **STOP** in the dogs face, and she started punching her dog in the head - not nearly as hard as I could, or would have, but good enough I guess.

After about a minute, the dog released my pup and I knocked it the fuck out within 30 seconds, causing it to go into complete submission.  The owners rounded up their dog and locked it in the truck, a bystander let us know she had the police on the way, and another bystander (THANK YOU WHOEVER YOU WERE PUG OWNING GIRL!!) grabbed my male as soon as she could so that my male wouldn't retaliate - he's very protective of me and his little sister - and held him back from making a bad scene worse.

Police showed up, separate the three of us, and do the usual interview.  I have contact info for the owner of the Pit because of this, but her number keeps going to an unactivated Rogers voicemail box.  I would like to visit her apartment this week if she doesn't buy some minutes soon for her phone, but then again when I'm in Victoria I'm on foot with dogs, and there's no way I'm letting my bitch back around that asshole of a Pit.

The police advised me that this was not a criminal matter, and that it was now civil so I would have to work it out with the owner, and failing that, civil litigation.  After the interview was complete and I had the owners details and the police file number, a very kind officer offered me a ride down the street to the 24 hour clinic near Tim Hortons to get her looked at, as she had visible puncture wounds with blood seeping out and was shaking from adrenaline.  

We were lucky, and the Pit just missed her rib cage, but went deep into the right shoulder muscle just behind her leg.  She's home, and resting mostly comfortable, and on pain killers and anti-biotics.  The area is beginning to swell (it's coming up on 48 hours), we've been applying warm compresses often as instructed, and been enforcing rest.  But, this idiotic dog owner has now left me with an almost $700 bill for the initial visit, and who knows if that will be the only one.

I'll post some pictures of the wounds when I can, wife is out and pics are on her cell.

Anyone have any ideas on what I should be doing regarding any of this?  I need to recoup this money as soon as I can, I just missed a mortgage payment, my condo is empty until the weekend when it rents again (been sitting for a month and a half), my dog is shaken but fine, and there's a dog out there who has extreme aggression issues towards other dogs.

I've worked with aggressive dogs a little bit, but I'm no dog trainer.  I've seen dogs go from being hyper aggressive on contact to learning how to become a dog and meet other dogs, play, and just become normal.  But this dog is different.  Neither of my dogs gave any indication of knowing a dog was even there in the truck, or that there was any threats around, and trust me - they fucking tell me through their body language.  There was no time to react, no time to separate the dogs like in a scrap, this was an all out attack.  Friday night I didn't want to make a bigger deal of this, but now I've been thinking and this dog should not be out on the street.

Saanich Police said that they were putting in a referral on the dog for a follow up from Animal Control.  

Any ideas on what I should be doing?

And sorry if this is fragmented at all.  I'm still shaken, I'm sore as hell, and every time I think about the incident my blood boils.  I had my knife on me, but there was no time to draw as it was in my right pocket, and that's where I landed on the pavement.  When I close my eyes all I can see is images from that night, it's really wearing on me.  I'm a big guy (230lbs), and I work well with adrenaline, but my brain isn't liking the after effects.  I'm a dog lover through and through and would never want to hurt a dog or kill it, unless it's been bitten in the zombie apocalypse and about to turn, but I'm surprised at how much I wanted to kill that dog, and yet how much I restrained myself from actively hurting it.  I wish I had a karambit or a small neck knife or something, as I could have accessed that much easier than something in my pocket.  Just something.  Ideas on that would be greatly appreciated too.  Not that I'm out trying to be Rambo or looking for trouble, but sometimes... yeah.  Sometimes it's needed.

**Edit/TL;DR** - MY dog got bit by a pitbull mix, police came, I have a file number and the owners apartment address, but they're not answering their phone.  I have a $700 vet bill, and need to extract money from the person whose dog bit mine.  I'm angry, and there's a black pitmix in the Gorge area that is extremely aggressive and attacks other dogs with no warning and on sight.  How can I fuck this person and their dog the most?

**Edit 2:** http://www.saanich.ca/living/dogs/bcdoglaw.html

*When an incident concerning a dog occurs, an animal control officer will assess each case on an individual basis. If the officer believes the dog is dangerous and the owner of the dog refuses to give the dog up to the authorities, the officer may obtain a warrant to seize the dog from private property. Once a dog has been seized, it may be impounded pending a provincial court order of destruction.*

*The animal control officer must be able to convince a justice of the peace that there are reasonable grounds for the dangerous dog assessment and that a warrant should be issued for the seizure and impoundment of the dog. In an application for a provincial court order, the judge must be convinced that the destruction of the animal is in the public interest. The dog owner would have the opportunity to be heard by the judge.*

I'll be talking to Animal Control in the morning, and see if they have any knowledge on recouping costs from the bite, as well as potentially seizing the dog.  

**Edit 3:** Further: http://www.crd.bc.ca/animal/dangerous.htm

*Local bylaws, provincial statutes and criminal code provisions provide several means of dealing with dangerous dogs. CRD Bylaw and Animal Care Services is prepared to use any of them to protect the public.*

*If a dog performs a vicious act it must be muzzled and leashed.
Dogs that are likely to kill or injure, or have killed or injured, can be ordered destroyed by the Provincial Court.*

*If an owner cannot or will not control a dangerous dog, the above provision is used.*

*Anybody finding a dog running at large and harassing people or domestic animals can kill the dog except in the case of dog fights.*

**Owners of Dangerous Dogs can be:**

*Fined: Dogs that act viciously are deemed not to be under effective control. This is a by-law offence.*

*Fined Up to $2,000 and imprisoned for five years: Assault charges could be laid if a dog is purposefully allowed to attack a person. This is a criminal offence.*

*Penalty ranges from fines up to $2,000 to five years imprisonment.
Charged: Criminal negligence charges are possible if an owner fails to control a dog with vicious propensity.*

*Penalty for criminal negligence causing bodily harm is punishable by up to ten years imprisonment. If someone is killed the penalty could be life imprisonment.*

*Sued: Civil Liability. Owners of vicious dogs can be successfully sued for damages if it can be proved their dog caused an injury and if the owner cannot establish they were unaware of this propensity. They may also be found liable for negligence if they failed to control their dog.*

*Not Insured: It is possible that awards can surpass insurance coverage.

The reason it must be food grade is it will be going into a herbal vaporizer - I'm a medical cannabis patient on a tight budget and would prefer not to be paying the going rate of $12.50 *per screen* for a less than 2 inch square.  I will be replacing it frequently, she just want the option to do this cheaply.

Usually I know where to find things like this, but honestly folks, I'm at a loss as to where to look.  Google keeps trying to sell me bulk from China, but I don't need rolls of this stuff.

>The first fire was a dumpster fire off Duplin Road a little before 10 o'clock last night. The the ABC restaurant at the Accent Inn went up in flames near 11 o'clock last night.

VictoriaBC,IcanByourwhore,"A Mother's plea for help, Victoria! If you may remember, my Indigenous daughter was assaulted by her landlord at the beginning September. I made a plea for help with a kind response but unfortunately, nothing came of the offers.

I get it, people's lives get busy and things that they may have been able to do one day, can change to the next. This post isn't meant to shame anyone.

Unfortunately, my daughter is about to give up. She tells me that she's done. She has no one and is so lonely. And now she's fearful that she'll get Omnicrom to boot, all though she's 2 Vax + booster, so it's not so much about how sick she'll get but how isolated she is if she needs help.

For Christmas, I got my her a ribbon skirt dedicated to #MMIW. Its beautiful crimson skirt meant to be a reminder of our forgotten Sisters. However, now I'm petrified that she'll also become a statistic.

She's far from home, alone, and would be homeless if she lost her job. Due to her loneliness and crying herself to sleep every night, she's acuitely depressed although she's on meds and feels like everything is too much to bear. She has no energy to fight back.

I talk her through her days and talk to her when she gets back to her room. I have several other high/special needs kiddos who also depend upon me too.

I know beggars can't be choosers but I'm hoping for offers that wouldn't require much effort for her. To help build her a support network to help give her purpose. I put this request out on a wing and a prayer.....thank you for reading. Mussi.","Homeless, Sooke Homelessness Coalition",1,False,25.0
VictoriaBC,IcanByourwhore,"Landlord assaulted my daughter. HELP! My eldest's first landlord assaulted her within the first day of her tenancy. 

We called the Saanich PD and were advised that if she ever felt in danger to not hesitate and call 911 but advised filing an assault charge after I got her safe, as they understood the difficult housing sitch. 

I got her moved out and into another place this past weekend. Now, she is emotionally breaking down. She can't sleep, eat or concentrate. She knows no one in Victoria.

I am a 2.5 day drive away in waaaaaaay northern BC and am feeling very helpless. What kind of support services are there aside from VictimLinkBC, more boots on the ground help?

TIA.

Edited to add: A police report has yet to be filed as my daughter just moved to safety this weekend. Her mental processes are so numb, jumbled that she can't think straight to file a report and as being a young Indigenous woman, is afraid of the police.

Is there anyone that can help her navigate these processes?

VictoriaBC,Ikarus8737,"Moving to Victoria- Neighborhood Recommendations We are a family of 4 with a 9 year old boy, 13 year old girl and an active dog relocating to Victoria from Ottawa for work (work is near Douglas/Hillside). We currently live in a very small home in an area that is very urban but also surrounded by beautiful nature.

It is ridiculous to expect to check all of our boxes, but we would appreciate some Victoria area/neighborhood recommendations based on our needs/criteria:

* 800 000-1 000 000 price range
* An safe/quiet area that typically has larger single family homes with space for visiting family to stay with a larger kid/dog friendly yard.
* Walking distance or short drive/bus to good schools (particularly a good high school, ideally with a good arts focus).
* Preferably walking distance/short drive to a grocery store.
* Preferably walkable to the ocean or beautiful parks. Places we can walk the dog to and where the kids can play/hangout. Nice treed neighborhood.
* Preferably with transit service
* Not too onerous a commute to Douglas/Hillside and downtown (15-20 min). We would be willing to commute a bit further if we could be in a community that checks the boxes above with nicer nature and better housing.

So far it seems that Gordon Head may be the best option. Oak Bay is too expensive and houses are small in our price range. Fernwood seems kind of like where we are now but (perhaps) not great for nature close by to walk to (also small houses). I'm not sure about Colwood and Langford. I saw some beautiful properties in Malahat but I would imagine that they are isolated and the kids would need to be driven everywhere.

VictoriaBC,IllIlIllIllIlIlIllI,"VicBC.Community - A New COVID-19 Web Portal Hey everyone, over the past several days I've been chipping away at a doc/site which attempts to bring together a wide variety of helpful info & resources for navigating the COVID-19 pandemic in Victoria (and elsewhere) in a somewhat less overwhelming format than the inevitable 'wall of text' approach. I also wanted to create something that is both desktop and mobile-friendly, and potentially collaborative. It'll continue to be a work-in-progress, especially since I'm now reaching out to others in the community who might want to contribute/collaborate in order to make it as useful and accessible as possible (if you're interested, send an email to the address on the site - I don't use reddit much).

I've also created an accompanying ['local remote events and activities' calendar](https://teamup.com/ks71qmabzfsjebw2oz), which is also still being tweaked.

You can find the site at **[vicbc.community](https://vicbc.community)** (a simpler redirect name than the doc link, but you can use that too).

## **Call for Submissions: Envisioning _The Future_**
---

- **What are your hopes & fears for our communities and the world beyond COVID-19?**
- **How might our societies look after we move past the current pandemic? In what ways will our cities and neighbourhoods change?**
- **How will we behave differently? And how might our relationships with technology, government, the environment, each other, and ourselves transform?**
- **How do we get there, and where will we be headed then?**

In these tumultuous times, it's important to collectively take a step back to reflect upon how we ended up here, and to envision what opportunities and challenges might lie ahead. Sharing forward-thinking ideas and stories can also help make our journeys through foreboding circumstances less isolating and arduous.

**You're invited to submit a piece of writing or art imagining a world where the current pandemic is a shared memory.**

This can be somber or lighthearted, and anyone is welcome to share their vision. A select number of submissions will be featured on _The Future_ blog (and eventually as a free digital book), while most others will be posted in a public archive.

**Want to join _The Future_**? Sign-up for updates and read the submission guidelines **[here](https://write.as/thefuture/)**.

---

In the meantime: 

**Stay home, [if you can](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R7KSy8lLfOAOMRN77ibfqW0RUS8e3nJjTEu93jdTMEk/edit).**

**Stay safe, and [look out for others](https://resilientneighbourhoods.ca/resilient-communities-and-neighbourhoods).**

**Stay connected, but be wary of [news overload](https://www.wired.com/2017/08/fomo/).**

VictoriaBC,Ill_Kale_4507,"My own personal experience 7 years homeless in BC mostly in Victoria  I spent 15 years homeless in the streets across Canada. My father was a drug addict that died when I was in jail when I was 18 year's old. I've overcome all my addictions. Drinking smoking ciggs and weed. My mother is an alcholic addicted to pills. Since I was a child. I'm actually from the hood of this country.. Hamilton Ontario close to Toronto 30 mins away. Makes Surrey look like a joke. BC out of every province I've been to. ACTUALLY on foot in the streets living in poverty. That allows drugs to be used legally and where people smoke meth and do needles in homeless shelters. No where in Canada have I experienced that in a homeless shelter. And only in BC is there a drug pandemic like no where else in Canada where you can use freely in the open legally and cops walk by and do nothing. When I was on drugs the only thing that fixed me and made me stop was jail. You lack real life experience. Now I have a condo and am an advocate of homelessness in Victoria bc I spent 6 years homeless out here google my name Cory Resilient you'll see news articles from Victoria news and documentaries with me in them when I was homeless. You haven't been to where I come from or all over the country province to province (ACTUALLY IN THE STREETS HOMELESS) like I have. So truly. You are the one who ignorant and stupid. This is what I mean about the privilege out here. BC is blind. And foolish. And ignorant. This isn't he suburbs of Canada the safest place you can go in this country and the nicest place but the only place that has such a bad drug problem. Go ahead. Blame it on the weather lol I dare you. Fool. [Proof](https://youtu.be/jwTKnTp7EdE) educate yourself

Also to educate others of what's truly contributing to poverty and homelessness, what the failures of the system are and what are the solutions, from those who are homeless or overcame homelessness and have the unique experience to really create real change and effect. Giving a new purpose and motivation for those who have experienced poverty all their lives, For us to find a way to have a purpose in our struggle, (Real Lived Experience) which brings true healing. In return brings real change, Which affects the entire community and world as a whole. 
first, awareness and education from the actual homeless need to be inherited, and opportunities can be created from the homless, for the homeless,

I'm going camping at Shingle Bay and Beaumont Marine Park at the end of the month. I know that as backcountry campsites there's no drinking water available, but I can't figure out if there are any freshwater sources nearby that I can just treat myself. I'd rather not have to lug several litres of bottled water around if I can just refill from a stream. Does anyone know if this is possible?

Edit: thanks for your replies everyone! I'll bring some chlorine tablets and a lifestraw just in case we stumble upon anywhere good, but we'll plan to rely on bottled water.","Camp, Camping, Community Plan to End Homelessness ",0,False,0.0

Island Rail Corridor needs $700 million in upgrades to get back on track

Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure assessment says rail is in poor to fair condition 

More than $700 million in upgrades and maintenance would be needed to get the Island Rail Corridor – formerly the E&N Rail – up and running again and even more to implement commuter service.

The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MoTI) released an assessment of the rail corridor on April 28. The entire length of the track was assessed to provide information for use by the government on future potential investment on the route owned by the Island Corridor Foundation.

According to a summary report, overall results show that the railway corridor is in poor to fair condition, with the Victoria section in the poor to fair range and the Port Alberni section in the poor range. Main issues include uncontrolled vegetation in and near the rail corridor and the number of decayed ties exceeding regulations set out by Transport Canada.

The report says single shoulder plates and angle joint bars used on the corridor are also considered “older technology” and negatively impact track performance.

Bridges are anywhere between poor to good condition depending on the age, location and type of bridge. At-grade crossings are in a fair condition but in some cases, are overgrown with vegetation or require improved warning systems.

Improvements have been recommended based on a phased approach which was developed as part of the MoTI study. It entails three phases.

The first phase includes costs to upgrade infrastructure to re-establish freight and passenger service of about two to four passenger trains per day and two to four freight trains per day. This phase is estimated to cost $326,448,391.

The second phase would further upgrade infrastructure and accommodate increased freight and passenger volumes at higher speeds. There would be four to eight passenger trains per day and four freight trains per day with up to 4 million tonnes in weight per year or 133 cars per day total. This phase, combined with the initial phase, is estimated to cost $552,023,932.

The third phase would support even higher freight and passenger volumes and is optimal for the implementation of a commuter rail service, which has its own costs. This phase, including the costs of the two previous phases, would bring the total to $728,778,304.

Implementing commuter rail service would add an additional estimated $595,029,867. It would involve work such as signalling upgrades, land acquisition, a maintenance facility and phased improvements on the Victoria to Langford corridor.

MoTI is currently developing a South Island Transportation Strategy, focusing on the efficient movement of people and goods. The strategy will look at all modes of transportation across southern Vancouver Island, including rail, and is expected to be released in June.

 Victoria -

The United States Coast Guard is warning boaters after 40 shipping containers were tossed from a cargo ship in rough seas off Vancouver Island.

The containers were adrift approximately 69 kilometres west of Vancouver Island just before 3 p.m., according to the U.S. officials.

The inbound cargo vessel listed to one side and the containers dropped into the ocean near the mouth of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the authorities said.

The U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center sent out a broadcast to mariners Friday afternoon warning that the lost containers may be partially submerged and not easily visible from the surface.

""Mariners should exercise extreme caution"" when transiting the region, the centre warned.

 The results of the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's (CMHC) latest report are in, and if you’re looking to rent a unit in the capital region, the results are not in your favour.

""We saw the vacancy rate decline to one per cent in purpose built rentals and zero percent in condo rentals,"" said Pershing Sun, senior economic analyst with CMHC.

These numbers are the result of CMHC’s annual rental market survey. It put the capital region in a tough spot nationally for 2021.

""This makes Victoria one of the markets with the lowest vacancy rates in Canada,"" said Sun. ""It’s actually even lower than Vancouver’s.""

 It should be noted that CMHC only compiles data on the condo rental market and purpose built rentals. It does not look into the basement suite market.

The national average vacancy rate for purpose-built two-bedroom rentals sits at 3.1 per cent.

Greater Victoria shares the lowest vacancy rate in the country with Peterborough and Halifax. Both are sitting at one per cent as well.

On the pricing side, the national average for a 2-bedroom unit goes for $1,167 a month.

The most expensive place to rent in Canada in 2021 was Vancouver at $1,824 a month for a two-bedroom. Behind Vancouver is Toronto at $1,666 a month, followed by Greater Victoria at $1,571 a month.
'INUNDATED WITH PEOPLE LOOKING'

Greater Victoria resident Shannon Robbins owns two basement suites and manages six others.

She says, when she posts a unit for rent, she sees how desperate people have become to find a place to call home in this nearly impossible rental market.

""Just flooded, inundated with people looking,"" she said.

""Within seconds I get 50 to 100 applicants of people asking to see the place.""

Currently, she is getting $1,450 a month for a furnished two-bedroom suite. She says she knows she could get a lot more for that unit, but won’t.

""I could jack it up to $2,400 if I wanted,"" said Robbins. ""That’s what the market says but I don’t think that’s fair.""

Renter Khalid Elbyok just secured a rental on Friday, but he almost left the region if it wasn’t for a little online luck after posting on social media.

""In order to find a room you really have to hustle,"" he said.

""I just explained that if I don’t get a room now I’m going to be leaving the city and I love this city and can somebody please help me out.""

He will be paying $500 a month for a room in a shared accommodation, and he knows he got a deal.

""It’s not a surprise I guess, unfortunately, that we’ve seen such a huge spike in rents and a drop in vacancy,"" said Peter Milobar, opposition finance critic and MLA for Kamloops-North Thompson.

Milobar says it’s time that the NDP government fulfills the promise it made to renters in B.C. years ago.

""They were promised a $400 renters rebate from this government in the 2017 election, and again in the 2020 election,"" said Milobar.

""The minister's simple response to us was frankly a flippant, 'We’re working on it,' he said. ""That’s not a good enough answer five years into this government's promise of a $400 renters rebate.""

On Friday, B.C.'s Minister Responsible for Housing, David Eby, told CTV News that the renters rebate was still coming.

""The government remains committed to bringing in a renters rebate during it’s mandate,"" he said in a statement.

The statement went on to say that the NDP government won’t be taking any lessons from the old government, which he says would cancel the speculation tax, repeal renters protections and make renters pay even more.","Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness , Social Housing , Victoria Women's Transition House",1,True,50.0

B.C. gives thousands of smartphones to homeless amid pandemic

VICTORIA -- The B.C. government is providing thousands of homeless and vulnerable people with pre-loaded smartphones amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

In total, 3,500 smartphones will be distributed across B.C. by community organizations and the Social Planning and Research Council of B.C. (SPARC BC).

As of Tuesday, 1,000 of the cellphones had already been handed out, including 200 that were directed to homeless campers transitioning out of Victoria’s Topaz Park and Pandora Avenue, and from Vancouver’s Oppenheimer Park.

 “For people who are experiencing homelessness, the closing of public spaces like libraries due to COVID-19 has reduced connectivity options and created barriers to supports and services,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction, in a statement Tuesday.

“Providing smartphones for people on the street will help create easier access to those services, help people maintain physical distancing, and support people in staying connected to family and friends during this time.”

Each of the 3,500 cellphones will be able to connect to Wi-Fi and come pre-loaded with a $10 7-Eleven data card.

 In Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside, many of the phones will be loaded with SIM cards that provide unlimited nationwide talk and text, and three gigabytes of data per month. The SIM cards were donated by Telus at a $0 monthly rate.

“These smartphones are lifelines and a long-term asset for people living in the Downtown Eastside and SROs [single room occupancy hotel units],” said Wendy Pedersen, coordinator of the Downtown Eastside SRO Collaborative in a statement.

“With the smartphones, we are also able to co-ordinate the drop-off of thousands of bars of soap, food and hygiene supplies to people and connect with people about COVID-19 symptoms and testing.”

Last week, the B.C. government extended its deadline to dismantle the homeless encampments at Victoria’s Topaz Park and Pandora Avenue.

All campers were expected to be moved into indoor sheltering by May 9. The deadline has since been extended to May 20.

As of May 8, roughly 250 homeless people remained at Topaz Park and along Pandora Avenue.

Use of Motor Homes and Campers During the COVID-19

April 7, 2020

With the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, there is a need for physical distancing and self isolation, as mandated by the Province.  For those required to self isolate, increased pressures are placed on families to provide separated space for family members, which may not be possible within the home.

The District is doing everything it can to support community residents and help them to stay safe.  This includes temporarily relaxing the Zoning Bylaw regulations to allow family members to make use of their campers, trailers or motor homes on their residential property to self-isolate during this situation.

If you will be making use of your recreational vehicle for self isolation, we ask that you please contact the Building and Planning Department at inspections@oakbay.ca or call (250) 598-2042 x7403 to let us know.

Victoria, BC – A man is deceased after an officer-involved shooting in Victoria this morning.

Shortly before 10 a.m. Saanich Police Department officers were called to the 3500-block of Douglas Street for a report of an armed man in crisis and making threats. While attending, officers learned of an additional report that the man had stolen from a nearby liquor store while armed. Several officers from VicPD deployed to the scene at Douglas Street and Tolmie Avenue to assist with the incident, given the close proximity to VicPD’s policing area.

Officers engaged with the man until approximately 11 a.m. An interaction then occurred between VicPD officers and the armed man, and a VicPD officer shot the man.

VicPD officers then immediately transitioned to provide emergency first aid to the man, while BC Emergency Health Services Paramedics moved in to take over medical care. However, the man died of his injuries on scene.

A man readying to leave the City of Victoria’s Johnson Street parkade on Sunday morning had an encounter with an attempted carjacker, police say. Nobody was physically injured in a wild incident described by VicPD below:

Victoria, BC – Patrol officers arrested a man yesterday morning after a foot pursuit in downtown Victoria.

At approximately 7 a.m. on Sunday, October 31st, Patrol officers responded to a parkade in the 700-block of Johnson Street for a report of a man attempting to break into an occupied vehicle. The victim reported that he was inside his vehicle, attempting to leave the parkade, when a man first tried to open his vehicle door before smashing a rear window. The suspect then fled the scene on foot.

Officers located the suspect leaving the scene and gave chase on foot. Officers deployed a Conductive Energy Weapon during the foot pursuit, however it was ineffective. Officers continued to chase the suspect on foot until additional responding officers took the suspect to the ground in the area of Johnson and Broad streets. No one was physically injured as a result of this incident.

Officers continued their investigation and believe that this incident was an attempted carjacking. The suspect was transported to VicPD cells where he was later released with a court date and conditions.

Bill C-75, which came into effect nationally in 2019, legislated a “principle of restraint” that requires police to release an accused person at the earliest possible opportunity after considering certain factors which include the likelihood the accused will attend court, the imminence of the risk posed to public safety, and the impact on confidence in the criminal justice system. 

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides that every person has the right to liberty and the presumption of innocence pre-trial.  Police are also asked to consider the circumstances of Indigenous or vulnerable persons in the process, in order to address the disproportionate impacts that the criminal justice system has on these populations.

VictoriaBC,InValensName,"BC Ferries removes Wi-Fi from from major sailing routes https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/bc-ferries-removes-wi-fi-from-from-major-sailing-routes-1.5558565

VICTORIA -- BC Ferries has removed its Wi-Fi services on vessels sailing along its most popular routes, following numerous complaints about its quality.

The internet service was powered down on July 5 for the following routes: Tsawwassen to Swartz Bay, Horseshoe Bay to Departure Bay, and Horseshoe Bay to Langdale.

BC Ferries says the move comes after years of increasing complaints about the poor connection quality, and the lack of a feasible replacement system.

 ""Extensive research and analysis of various technology solutions has shown it is not possible to improve the Wi-Fi service on our ferries to the level expected by users and we continually receive complaints about the quality and reliability of the service,"" reads an update on the BC Ferries website.

BC Ferries first introduced Wi-Fi aboard sailings in 2010 through its own land-based radio devices.

The company says that over the past 11 years, demand for the Wi-Fi has risen from about 40 to 50 users per sailing to more than 900, which strains the system.

Any replacement system, such as satellite or cellular technology, would be prohibitively expensive and would likely be unable to accommodate the volume of users per sailing, according to BC Ferries.

An airline can offer internet services for passengers because planes carry far fewer passengers than the roughly 900 passengers that sail on larger BC Ferries vessels, says the company.

Moreover, changes in radio standards means that Wi-Fi coverage would be even worse in the future if BC Ferries kept its current system in place.

""The existing Wi-Fi service runs on a ship-to-shore network using wireless network radios which we would need to upgrade and certify under newer, stricter Radio Frequency (RF) regulations,"" says the company.

""These newer radio devices have a large reduction in the amount of power we can apply to its network radios, which would further reduce the reliability and quality of onboard Wi-Fi.""

Free Wi-Fi service is still available at most BC Ferries terminals, including Tsawwassen, Swartz Bay, Horseshoe Bay, and more than a dozen others.

A 27-year-old man has been arrested following an arson fire and theft at a Walmart in Campbell River last week.

The theft occurred around 10 p.m. on October 1. A video circulating online shows a fire burning in the toilet paper aisle as smoke fills the store.

It was determined the fire was intentionally set as a diversion tactic to enable a very significant theft from the store.

Thousands of dollars worth of electronics, including phones and iPads, were stolen as the store was being evacuated.

RCMP are warning the public to avoid any “too good to be true” prices for electronics.

“It’s very buyer beware, as items that are stolen can be disabled by the manufacturer when they are brought online,” reads a statement released by RCMP on Friday.

The small blaze which ended up causing damage in the millions of dollars temporarily shuttered one of the largest retailers in Campbell River for the Thanksgiving long weekend, with no reopening date set at this time.

“We’re doing everything we can to re-open the store… We need to ensure the store is safe and up to the standards Campbell River customers expect,” a spokesperson for Walmart told the Campbell River RCMP in a statement.

The suspect from Campbell River is facing recommended charges of arson with a disregard for human life, theft over $5,000 and mischief over $5,000.

“This was and continues to be a group effort for our detachment,” said Inspector Jeff Preston. “The professionalism and skill with which our officers have conducted this investigation has provided the opportunity to hold the correct person accountable.”

Opinion: The sad decline of Victoria’s Douglas Street

If you only knew Douglas Street’s most southern end where it intersects with Dallas Road at Beacon Hill Park, you’d think it was one of the loveliest streets on Vancouver Island. It has an ocean-view of the United States where the road terminates, with greenery flanking it on both sides. Occasional tents, now deemed illegal to the relief of the neighborhood’s residents, are the only blemish on the otherwise idyllic street.

Unfortunately, this is not the Douglas Street that everybody knows or pictures when they hear its name.

The majority of Douglas Street is a grimy, decaying thoroughfare that would resemble a ghost town if it weren’t for the constant stream of double-decker buses at Fort Street. When was the last time somebody asked a friend to go spend the day hanging out on Douglas Street? Maybe if they are going to the Public Market at the Hudson, if they are seeking typically yuppie activities.

When people usually spend time in Douglas, they are getting drunk at one of the street’s institutions of inebriation like the Sticky Wicket or Peacock Billiards. Another popular place to not bring your car keys is the local Cactus Club, which is a wealthy chain that can afford to operate a business on Douglas. That Cactus Club outlet is not unlike many of the other businesses that can afford to locate itself on Douglas, where it looks inevitable that only corporate empires can survive. For evidence, some of the only businesses that seem secure on Douglas are Cactus Club, Dollarama, McDonalds, and Shoppers Drug Mart.

Douglas Street has become the graveyard of small business in Victoria’s downtown core. Even the outlets in the Bay Centre that face Douglas Street seem unable to retain operators for more than a year. The Bay Centre itself feels like a husk of a mall, hollowed out by the development of Uptown and the attractive business climate of the rapidly growing West Shore communities. It is perhaps no coincidence that the only businesses in the Bay Centre that seem healthy, like Hudson’s Bay or Below the Belt, face Government Street on the other side of the mall.

The sheer amount of visible poverty on Douglas Street is growing as well. Pandora Avenue is the closest thing Victoria has to a Skid Row, and whether it is the closest thing or the real thing at this point is ambiguous. Not only is Pandora’s poverty seemingly permanent at this point, but its sad character is leaking onto Douglas as well and cementing itself there outside the Shoppers Drug Mart and the McDonald’s. The street’s troubling decay is not limited to people sleeping in doorways. The many historic apartments, such as the ones above the Circle-K at Yates and Douglas, are decrepit with no hopes for restoration in a city that supposedly still prides itself on its architectural heritage.

It is worth asking: do people feel safer walking alone at night on Government Street or Douglas Street? Most people will answer with the former, and for good reason. Attacks on strangers are all too frequent on Douglas, including a store employee who has headbutted in February, and a driver’s window that was smashed by a rock in an unprovoked attack. This is not the environment that creates a healthy economy, or an attractive venue for one.

Douglas Street will never be Government Street, and nobody should expect it to be. Government is relatively unimportant for vehicular traffic, and one of the crown jewels of Victoria’s tourism hubs. Douglas forms part of Highway 1, which connects to the West Shore and up-Island, and connects with Highway 17, which lead to the ferries. They are two streets that serve different purposes. Nonetheless, there is no good excuse to allow Douglas to continue on its grubby decline to a place only popular after 10 p.m. on Friday.

The new Telus Office Tower that was approved by the city government will hopefully do something to reverse the emaciation of Douglas Street. Future well-paid professionals will pump thousands of dollars per week into the struggling cafes and smaller businesses on Douglas that are barely surviving right now.

Victoria’s downtown has not been in good shape for a long time and a healthy Douglas Street will help that revival. How that is achieved is up to the politicians, but allowing one of Victoria’s longest and most important streets to fade away cannot be allowed to continue.

VictoriaBC,InValensName,"Dallas road seawall replacement to cost $3.8 million https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/victoria-council-to-consider-replacing-dallas-road-railing-for-3-8m-1.4837400

VICTORIA -- City of Victoria staff are recommending that council amend the 2020 financial plan to include $3.85-million in funding for the replacement of the more than 60-year-old balustrade along Dallas Road near Ogden Point.

The 500-metre balustrade runs parallel to Dallas Road along the Victoria waterfront between Ogden Point and Lewis Street. Constructed in 1957, the barrier is considered to be beyond the end of its service life, say staff.

In some areas, concrete sections of the balustrade are crumbling as it delaminates, and some of the structural steel is corroding. Meanwhile, parts of the balustrade's surface is stained with rust. 

 In 2016 the balustrade was identified as an area that required restoration work. In 2018, the city completed a four year structural restoration program of the nearby vertical seawall sections along Dallas Road, but did not conduct work on the balustrade. 

In August 2019, city council endorsed a replacement for the 500-metre balustrade with a stanchion and cable design similar to the rails along the Ogden Point breakwater. City staff was directed to report back to council to request construction funding when the planning and design work was complete.

The report is now before council for the metal and concrete barrier, which stands as the final piece of the area's restoration project.

The primary recommendation made to council in the staff report is to remove the existing balustrade and install the new one in coordination with the current construction of the CRD Wastewater project along Dallas Road. The work would coincide with the construction already underway in the area, including a new cycling path and angled parking.

City staff say that an important factor in the design of the new stanchion and cable balustrade is accessibility. The new design would allow for expanded sidewalks, improved sightlines and provide room for benches along the balustrade.

An estimate last month pegged the cost of removing the existing balustrade, installing the new railing and associated road works to be $2.44-million. Including contingencies and administrative costs, the overall replacement cost is now estimated to be $3.85-million. If approved by council, installation of the replacement balustrade would be completed this year.

Victoria City Council will review the report at the upcoming committee of the whole meeting on Thursday.","Community Plan to End Homelessness , Coordinated Access and Assessment , Service provider ",0,False,11.11111111111111

 Councillors for the Township of Esquimalt have voted down supplemental budget requests from the Victoria Police Department, saying the municipality already pays disproportionately more for policing than it gets in return.

Council declined all requests for more funding for VicPD officers and civilian roles in the 2022 budget, with the exception of funding for restorative justice, the township said in a media release Tuesday.

The township cited a September 2020 review of policing costs in Victoria and Esquimalt by the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, which found Esquimalt paid approximately 14.7 per cent of VicPD's budget.

The report recommended Esquimalt's share of the budget be reduced to 13.67 per cent, which took effect this year, according to the township.

 However, Esquimalt says the cost still does not align with the municipality's demand for police services.

""We made further budget decisions this year, including the supplemental requests, that we believe are more in line with our use of resources from VicPD,"" said Esquimalt Mayor Barbara Desjardins in a statement.

""For instance, we know that overtime and other costs are increasing due to the number of protests we're seeing downtown,"" Desjardins added.

""While police presence is important for these types of events, Esquimalt should not be the only municipality in the region contributing to these costs simply because VicPD provides policing in our township.""

The township added that it does not get to make operational decisions about how the VicPD budget is used.

According to the municipality, Esquimalt paid $8.4 million for policing in 2021, or approximately $479 per resident.

""Public safety is top of mind, as is appropriate spending for our services,"" the mayor added. ""Our goal is to be adequately policed while fiscally responsible to our residents and businesses.""

The township says its staff will be surveying Esquimalt residents over the next two months to determine their level of satisfaction with the amalgamated VicPD arrangement before the arrangement comes up for renewal in July.

After debating whether they would even take place, the City of Victoria has decided that this year’s Canada Day fireworks will still go ahead — albeit with a change to reflect the Lekwungen territory they’re taking place on.

Mayor Lisa Helps provided a verbal update to council Thursday morning stating that the current plans for July 1, 2022 now include a multicultural street festival downtown beginning at noon, musical mainstage entertainment at 4 p.m. at Ship Point and then fireworks in the evening.

But instead of the national anthem playing through the fireworks, this year Lekwungen music will be worked into the presentation.

“There will be fireworks, and to kind of blend a celebration of Canada with fireworks and a recognition of Lekwungen territory, while the fireworks are going off the Lekwungen dancers, subject to inviting them and speaking with the nations, this is all just preliminary, will be performing as well,” Helps said to council.

“Usually it’s O Canada with fireworks blended and it will be rather fireworks with Lekwungen music blended.”

Helps said that a planning committee has nixed the traditional “living flag” event, however, in part because it’s “a lot of work” to organize and there are concerns about people squeezing together during the COVID-19 pandemic.

There will still be opportunities for members of the public to participate in events in some way, whether it be an interactive map of the world or photo contests, Helps said.

This year’s celebration will see Government Street closed from Humboldt to Belleville streets, and Belleville Street closed from Douglas to Menzies streets between noon and 8 p.m.

Helps noted that the mainstage celebration has been moved from the B.C. Legislature grounds to Ship Point because the city expects protesters to stage demonstrations at the legislature.

It will be the first time since the start of the pandemic that Victoria will hold in-person Canada Day celebrations.

Three weeks ago Adriana Londono received the worst phone call a parent could imagine — her 12-year-old daughter was dead.

“I just ran to the bathroom and cried and screamed, it was probably the worst moment of my whole life,” Londono said.

Allayah Thomas, who went by Ally, started experimenting with drugs last fall at just 11 years old. Her family says it escalated until she was using meth and heroin.

The Grade 6 Saanich student overdosed three times ending up at Victoria General Hospital, but her fourth overdose, at a friend’s house in Langford on April 14, proved fatal.

“She grew up too fast and I’m really sorry for that, I feel very guilty that I wasn’t there to help her or that I wasn’t the best mentor or the best mom,” Londono said.

Londono herself has struggled for years with mental health and substance use issues. She said she’s been to the hospital numerous times seeking help but has always been sent home. She said it was the same story when she and other family members tried to get help for Allayah.

“I feel like she needed to go into a long-term rehab facility but they didn’t make any for people her age, it’s wrong, because now she died and she’s only 12, they could have helped her I believe,” Londono said.

Ally’s grandparents, who she lived with, say all that the Grade 6 student was ever offered was counselling, which the young girl refused.

B.C.’s Children and Youth Representative says most substance use treatment services are designed for older children and teens but there’s no question more is needed.

“So it’s a wake-up call for us to think developmentally how would we work with these young people? And 12-year-olds shouldn’t be with 16-year-olds either,” she said. “There are significant gaps in the province, we’ve been identifying them for a number of years.”

Charlesworth said involuntary treatment should be available only as a last resort.

“The reality is detention and involuntary treatment is an important part of a whole array of options, but in the absence of having better voluntary options, I really am reluctant to kind of go right to involuntary treatment,” she said.

Adriana Londono says her little girl was failed by everyone, including her.

“If i was able to be there for her, if I had the help, and she had the help I think she would be here right now,” she said.

She says she’d like everyone to be aware of how toxic the drug supply is right now and she’s encouraging parents to keep open communication with their kids.

“Every kid should not be afraid to tell their parents what they’ve done, they shouldn’t be in fear of being punished, they should be in fear of dying is what I think is important.”","drug use, Drugs, Lived Experience, Overdose/overdosed , People with lived experience, Substance use",0,False,75.0
VictoriaBC,InValensName,"Greater Victoria pharmacies sell out of masks and hand sanitizer https://www.saanichnews.com/news/greater-victoria-pharmacies-sell-out-of-masks-hand-sanitizer-in-wake-of-coronavirus

Pharmacies across Greater Victoria are out of masks and hand sanitizer following reports of the new coronavirus making its way to B.C.

On Jan. 28, B.C. Provincial Health Officer Bonnie Henry confirmed that a man in his 40s who regularly visits China was diagnosed with the virus in Vancouver.

As of Thursday morning , the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that globally there are 7,818 confirmed cases, with 170 confirmed deaths, with a vast majority of cases being in China.

Since news of the virus hit the streets, people have scrambled for health equipment.

Staff at the downtown Rexall, located at 912 Douglas St., said they were sold out of masks, and that hand sanitizer was slowly depleting.

“The masks won’t prevent a viral infection, especially if you’re always readjusting them with unwashed hands,” a Rexall staff member told Black Press Media. “You’ve really just got to keep washing your hands.”

Rexall stores across the region are also sold out of masks, due to their manufacturers being sold out for the indefinite future.

The downtown Shoppers Drug Mart at 1212 Douglas St. is also out of masks, with none expected until next week. The shop did, however, get a new stock of hand sanitizer.

The View Street Pharmacy at 867 View St. said people scrambled in to buy masks two weeks ago.

“We are sold out of face masks, some people bought two or three boxes,” said pharmacist Akiko Friedland. “For hand sanitizer, we have six small units left, the big ones sold out.”

More masks are expected at that location in two weeks.

Island Health told Black Press Media that it has seen “a slight increase” in visits from people to emergency rooms concerned about the coronavirus.

“There is ongoing monitoring and planning calls occurring throughout the province to support all staff in education and next steps related to this health challenge,” said media spokesperson Valerie McKay in an email.

“At this time, public health officials remind everyone the risk to the public remains low. Similar to the cold and flu season, people should follow proper hand hygiene, cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, avoid others who are unwell, stay home when you are unwell, and remember to consult with family physician and care teams, urgent care centres or 811 as resources.”


**TLDR:** These masks are for when you are ALREADY sick so you can't sneeze at people. Masks like these are not sealing up your breathing passages, the virus will easily go around the outside of it and it prevents nothing. Washing your hands throughout the day is really where you can beat this thing. Also per BCCDC wearing a mask makes it more likely you will touch your face to adjust it during the day and this hugely INCREASES your chance of infection.

Victoria, BC – Patrol officers arrested a man this morning after he assaulted a woman with a hammer in Irving Park.

At 9:45 a.m. this morning Patrol officers were called to Irving Park in the 200-block of Menzies Street for a report of a loud verbal altercation. As officers were en route to the call they learned that the argument had escalated and a man had damaged a woman’s tent with a baseball bat, and then assaulted the woman with a hammer.

Officers arrived on scene and quickly located the suspect near his own tent in the park. Officers took the suspect into custody without further incident.

BC Emergency Health Services paramedics attended and treated the victim at the scene for non-life-threatening injuries.

The suspect, a 48-year-old man with a lengthy criminal history which includes more than 50 criminal convictions, was transported to VicPD cells and held in custody. The man faces recommended charges of assault with a weapon, breach of probation, and breach of a release order.

This file remains under investigation. It is not believed to be related to intimate partner violence.

Victoria, BC – Patrol officers arrested a man yesterday afternoon after a hate-motivated assault on a woman and her children.

Shortly after 12 p.m. on Tuesday, May 4th, a non-uniformed VicPD officer, in civilian clothes and driving their personal vehicle, witnessed a shirtless man acting erratically in the 3000-block of Quadra Street. The shirtless man yelled and postured aggressively toward a man and his child. The man and child moved away from the suspect for their safety and were not physically harmed.

The suspect then headed towards Quadra Elementary School. The officer followed the man and called for additional uniformed police officers to attend. The suspect then obtained a broom handle and approached a woman walking with a stroller and her four children. The man spat at the family, narrowly missing a child, and yelled racial slurs regarding the family’s Asian ethnicity. The non-uniformed officer approached to intervene and the man then attacked the non-uniformed officer’s vehicle, damaging it.

Uniformed officers arrived and arrested the man moments later. The man was transported to VicPD cells where he was held in custody. He faces recommended charges of assault and mischief. The incident is being treated as a hate-motivated crime.

British Columbia and North America have seen significant increases in hate-motivated crime towards Asian persons. Thankfully we have not seen a similar significant increase in these crimes towards Asian members of our Victoria and Esquimalt communities.

VICTORIA -- The City of Victoria is hosting a public meeting on the future of the city's controversial Sir John A. Macdonald statue Monday.

The city is asking participants to consider the historical context of Canada's first prime minister and to consider what role would be appropriate for the statue now.

The city stresses, however, that the discussion will not ""determine or debate the future home of the statue, but rather to help inform council decision-making on next steps.""

 Debate about Macdonald first erupted in August 2018 when the city removed a statue of the prime minister from outside of city hall. 

At the time, Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps said the removal of the statue was an important step towards reconciliation, and that the statue was causing a barrier to Indigenous participation at city hall. Macdonald, who served as MP for Victoria from 1878 to 1882, played a significant role in creating Canada's residential school system, which displaced thousands of Indigenous youth.

Soon after the statue was removed, Helps issued an apology for the lack of public consultation on the statue's removal, but did not back down from the decision to do so.

The statue of Canada's first prime minister remains in storage.

Monday night's meeting is scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. at the Victoria Conference Centre at 720 Douglas St.

The public dialogue is expected to begin with a ""theatrical presentation"" on the life and career of Sir John A. Macdonald, and will be hosted by Dr. Cindy Blackstock and Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps.

Another fast-food fried chicken chain is coming to BC’s capital.

HiFive Chicken is ready to bring its legs, thighs, wings and breasts to downtown Victoria, opening its first-ever Vancouver Island location later this summer.

The storefront at 1483 Douglas Street, near Pandora Avenue, is currently stamped in “opening soon” signage, including contact information for those looking to apply for a job.

Along with Victoria, the chain also plans to open a handful of other new stores on the Mainland, including in Coquitlam, Langley, Maple Ridge, Richmond and Surrey. 

“…the company has come a long way and continues to grow. The secret to the company’s expansion is the love and care we provide to our guests,” states the post.

VictoriaBC,InValensName,"Hundreds gather at UVic for unruly parties, fireworks shot at crowd TV sets, pumpkins, bottles thrown from buildings, witness says https://www.timescolonist.com/local-news/hundreds-gather-at-uvic-for-unruly-parties-fireworks-shot-at-crowd-4713251

A University of Victoria student says large drunken gatherings over the Halloween weekend are “a recipe for disaster” and UVic has to put a stop to it.

The student sent videos taken late Saturday from a room on the upper floors at UVic residences near Parking Lot 1 to media outlets, hoping “to shame UVic into doing something.”

The videos show hundreds of people gathered in a square outside residences chanting and yelling, and openly drinking as fireworks are set off. Someone then shoots fireworks into the crowd, where they explode as the partygoers scream.

The student, who did not want to be identified, fearing reprisals from the university and the people in the videos, said the gatherings and fireworks happened Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and lasted until 4 a.m.

Pumpkins and bottles were thrown from rooftops of the residences and several fights broke out, said the student, adding there was blood on the sidewalks Monday morning from broken glass and fights.

The student witnessed someone drive a vehicle into the same square area in the early hours of Oct. 3, narrowly missing six women seated on the grass. And the student has also watched people throw televisions and other items into the gathering area.

“I’m waiting for someone to die … is that when they’re going to put an end to this?” said the student, adding the outdoor parties have been happening since the start of the school year, almost every weekend.

Saanich Police Const. Markus Anastasiades confirmed there were mass gatherings of up to 1,000 people in the area Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and extra officers were dispatched on each of the three nights. Several tickets were issued for open liquor and minor injuries were noted, and at least one assault is being investigated, he said.

Paramedics were also called to check injuries. No officers were injured.

“People are so intoxicated, they weren’t able to care for themselves,” said Anastasiades. “People were firing fireworks into the crowds.”

Anastasiades said calls to UVic residences this year are unprecedented as hundreds gather for weekend parties.

“Enforcement up there, what we’re seeing, we haven’t seen before,” he said. “Some of them are students. Some are not. The university is being seen as a gathering ground for young people.”

Anastasiades said with Halloween falling on a Sunday, the partying continued through the weekend.

Karen Johnston, associate director of public affairs at UVic, said in a statement that many of the people who gathered on campus over the weekend were not UVic students.

The statement said mass parties in and around residence-complex buildings are not permitted for any reason, and any reported violations of that policy by UVic students from the past weekend will be followed up through “established conduct processes.”

Johnston said students were reminded prior to Halloween of the no-guest policy in residences and UVic’s policy of no open alcohol containers or consumption in public areas of the campus. Non-students and students not living in residence are not allowed inside or around living areas, including parking lots and grounds around the buildings.

Johnston said large unsanctioned gatherings on campus may increase the risk of COVID-19 spread and jeopardize the safety of the campus community and first responders.

The capital region was awash in fireworks and other explosives through the weekend and Halloween night, with complaints lodged to police from Sidney to the West Shore.

Anastasiades said police have a difficult time catching offenders. “By the time we get there , they are usually gone,” he said.

Fireworks are illegal to sell in all jurisdictions in the region, and firecrackers and other hand-held lit explosives are banned. Municipalities such as Saanich and Langford require special permits to light them on Halloween and only between certain hours.

But police said fireworks are easy to obtain online and through pop-up sellers outside their jurisdictions.

Far Out Fireworks, based in Coombs, claims to have the Island’s largest selection of fireworks and offers 24/7 online ordering, curbside pickup and two- or three-day shipping.

Calls to the business were not returned on Monday.

In Oak Bay, police were sent to break up a gathering of between 150 and 200 youth drinking and using fireworks on the Victoria Golf Club and Anderson Hill. That prompted a tweet by Oak Bay Police Chief Ray Bernoties on Monday, saying “we were all young once … but if your kid was one of the many who was partying on the grounds of Victoria Golf Course and/or Anderson Hill last night, they should return today to clean up the mess that was left behind.”","Alcoholic , Community Plan to End Homelessness , Complex care , People with lived experience",0,False,4.166666666666666

Island Outfitters aims to reopen in October in new View Royal location

 Island Outfitters, the region’s retail hub for hunters and anglers, which was abruptly shut down by an arson fire in January, is planning to open the first week in October in a new location and under new ownership.

Ian and Megan White and Brenda Lineham, who all worked at the original store on Douglas Street, have acquired the business from Ward Bond and Darren Wright. They plan to reopen Island Outfitters in the building formerly occupied by Andre’s Electronics and McKays at 1681-A Island Highway in View Royal.

 Megan White said Friday the 26-year-old company is still awaiting some permits to operate, but is hopeful for an opening during the first week in October. Work on the space is largely complete and the shelves are being stocked with merchandise as inventory continues to arrive, she said.

“We’re getting really good feedback from people; they’re happy we are opening again,” said White. “I think the new store [on the West Shore] makes it a little more convenient for people.”

The Jan. 4 fire dealt a severe blow to the business owners and staff, as well as hundreds of regular customers who frequented the store for hunting and fishing supplies. Victoria and Saanich fire departments said the blaze was started in storage sheds in the rear of the building on Douglas Street near Cloverdale Avenue. No one was hurt in the fire. The case is active, but no one has been charged.

White said Island Outfitters salvaged some of the inventory, and will be selling some of those items in a “fire sale” near the end of October in tents outside the new location.

“It was really hard for us to get it going again … we had the fire and then COVID came, so we’re really happy people were so patient and we had support,” said White.

She said most of the 20 employees are returning, and hiring will ramp up as the fishing season approaches in March.

Ian White is the general manager and has worked for Island Outfitters for more than 15 years. Megan White, who also has a long history with the company, is in charge of inventory, marketing and other duties. Lineham has been the backbone of the administration for more than a decade. Her husband, Mike, is also part of the new ownership group.

https://www.nbc.ca/content/dam/bnc/en/rates-and-analysis/economic-analysis/housing-affordability.pdf


You likely don’t need a reminder that it’s a struggle to purchase a home in Victoria, but a recent report has confirmed just that.

According to The National Bank of Canada’s Housing Affordability Report, Toronto, Victoria and Vancouver rank as the three most expensive major cities in Canada to purchase a home.

In Victoria, the average, representative non-condo home costs $1.02 million — meaning you would need an annual household income of $176k, and have to save for over 28 years to purchase a home.

For a condo, a person with an annual household income of $108k would need to save for almost four years.

According to the report, Victoria has seen a steep increase in rent as well, a trend which began halfway into 2019.

Comparatively, in Montreal — where housing affordability measures below the Canadian average — the average price of a home is $492k and a condo is $356k.

For someone with an income of six or five figures, saving for a home or condo rounds out to over three years and two years, respectively.

Globally, among the world’s perspectives in housing market price growth, Canada sits third— Turkey ranks second and Russia ranks first.

Per square foot, the report suggests that housing prices in Canada are not that extreme.

For a 700 square foot apartment, Hong Kong ranks first as the most expensive city with Tokyo and Paris rounding out the top three, and Vancouver coming 11th.

Since the housing crisis in 2008 though, Vancouver’s housing market has skyrocketed to more than double what it was before.

This, in turn, has affected Victoria’s market.

The good news is that the worst may be behind us,

Victoria is seeing both a plateau in its renter’s market and a downward trend in the housing market as of this year.

So, if you’re a seller, you’re in luck! And, if you’re a buyer, maybe you can hold out for hope!","Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , Home, Victoria Women in Need",1,True,6.666666666666667

Prosecutor said man was homeless, wanted to be arrested, and ­carried out an increasing level of criminal activity until he ended up in jail

A man who ran over a Victoria police officer with a stolen car outside Our Place last September has pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and assaulting a police officer with a weapon.

Chance Kenton Nichol, 29, also pleaded guilty to mischief for smashing the windows of two downtown businesses on Sept. 26, 2021.

The admissions of fact, read into the court record by Crown prosecutor Patrick Weir, reveal that Nichol was homeless, wanted to be arrested and ­carried out an increasing level of criminal activity until he ended up in jail.

The spree began around 1:30 p.m. on Sept. 26 when Nichol used rocks to smash the windows of an office building on Douglas Street and another on Broughton Street. Witnesses called 911, but fire and police were already on the way because the motion-sensor fire alarm had been triggered when Nichol entered the building, the admissions say.

Police didn’t find anyone and called off the search. At 4:37 p.m., the building manager found Nichol asleep in a room on the first floor that had been locked from the inside. Police arrested Nichol and drove him to the parking lot of McDonald’s on Pandora Avenue, where he said he lived.

When Nichol learned he would be released, he insisted the officers were obliged to take him to jail because he was homeless. They explained they were obliged to release him.

Nichol wanted to be taken to hospital, but because he didn’t appear to have any medical issues, the officers simply gave him directions to Royal Jubilee Hospital. They watched him throw away his release documents and go inside McDonald’s.

At 9:10 p.m., police were called to McDonald’s because Nichol was refusing to leave. An officer escorted him out of the restaurant. But he demanded to be arrested and banged his fists on the police car. Nichol asked to go to the Victoria Sobering Centre. The officer dropped him off, but he was not admitted.

Around 12:30 a.m., Nichol was taken by ambulance to the hospital, complaining of heroin withdrawal. He was discharged at 7:30 a.m. because he would not co-operate with treatment. Nichol took a bus to Oak Bay and found some car keys in the 1300-block of Beach Drive that he was able to match to a 2008 Cobalt parked nearby, the admissions say.

Nichol stole the car and ended up on Pandora Avenue, where police were assisting bylaw enforcement officers. He stopped behind a marked police vehicle. Const. Todd Mason, a 12-year-veteran, stood by the driver’s side window of the police vehicle talking to two officers.

Nichol pressed the accelerator and drove toward the police vehicle. Mason tried to jump out of the way but was hit. The officer hit the hood, front windshield and roof of the Cobalt and was propelled 15 feet in the air before striking the pavement. The car hit a garbage dumpster and came to a stop with one tire on Mason’s ankle.

Nichol was arrested at gunpoint. Mason has not returned to work, the admissions say.

Provincial court Judge Robert Higinbotham ordered a presentence report with a psychological component to assist at sentencing. Nichol is expected to set a date for his sentencing in mid-June.","Aboriginal Coalition to End Homelessness, Community Plan to End Homelessness , Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness , Homeless, Homelessness , Our Place, Victoria Native Friendship Centre ",0,True,5.0

The severity of a marine disaster off Vancouver Island is far worse than first reported, according to internal coast guard communications obtained by CTV News.

The emails sent on Tuesday evening show the vessel's owner underestimated the number of shipping containers that fell from the vessel during a storm.

Originally, the Canadian Coast Guard reported that 40 containers fell from the ship in heavy seas and high winds, but now it appears there are more than 100 containers are drifting off Vancouver Island.

""The owner now believes that 109 containers were lost in the initial event,"" one email says.

The email also says that only two of the containers are believed to have dangerous goods inside them.

In a situation update late Wednesday morning, the coast guard confirmed that more than 100 containers were lost.

""It has now been determined that 106 containers fell overboard, not 40 as originally estimated via aircraft observation shortly after the incident,"" the coast guard said.

The stricken Zim Kingston vessel continues to be anchored off Victoria.

Shortly after the containers slipped overboard, the vessel also suffered a serious fire inside containers on the ship. The fire continues to smoulder in containers at the bottom of a large stack.

The last time one of the drifting containers was spotted by a tracking flight was on Oct. 24 when the container was near Hesquiat Peninsula, northwest of Tofino, the communications show.

Due to vents on the containers that allow water in, the coast guard does not expect any of the boxes will be recovered.

Saanich police say the incident was captured on a security camera just before 7 p.m. near Burnside Road West and Harriet Road.

Police say a white woman in her 30s deliberately attached the needle and gauze using tape that was already on the door.

She is described as 5' 6"" tall with short brown hair. She was wearing a white hooded sweater, black jacket, black pants and black flip-flops at the time.

The new park is named Agamemnon and Eleni Kasapi Park in recognition of the family’s preservation of the property in its natural state for the benefit of the community. The City will maintain the open space with a few enhancements, such as: A wood chip pathway, Bench seating, Signage, including information about the Indigenous history of the land

The property has environmental significance as Garry oak ecosystems are endangered, with less than five per cent remaining in Canada.

Local residents have long expressed a desire to see this property preserved as green space for public use, leading the City to initiate discussions with the property owner about acquiring the land to create a new neighbourhood park.

Appraised at $1.21 million, the City purchased the property for $1 million with funding from its Parks Acquisition Fund and the issuance of a charitable donation receipt for the remainder of the purchase price. The family has donated the proceeds from the sale to the University of Victoria to establish an endowment supporting two undergraduate scholarships in the Faculty of Science.

Oak Bay chief puts an end to dad jokes on police Twitter

No more jokes on Oak Bay Police Twitter account 

The man behind what might be the most playful and active police Twitter account in Canada is taking his dad jokes to his personal account.

Newly appointed Chief Ray Bernoties will still use the Oak Bay Police Department Twitter account. But after years of mostly positive feedback, he’s seen enough negative feedback from dissenters and will shift the department’s main account to a bare bones, business-like use of social media.

“Creating my own account is something I had been contemplating but I have no interest in having a boring account filled with selfies to show the public that I attended various events,” Bernoties said on Monday. “Even my family wouldn’t want to follow that.”

Bernoties’ use of social media is part of the community engagement that Oak Bay Police is known for and will continue, he said.

“I like engaging people and showing our human side but, as you can imagine, if your goal is to have people hate police, our account was a problem and thus a magnet for cop-haters.”

Bernoties said he is worried his humour (or lackthereof) and cheeky demeanor may impact the image of his staff.

The current climate of anti-police sentiment has also played a role as ACAB (all cops are bastards) has shown up in his social media feed. Last week a vandal even spray-painted “kill police” in Oak Bay.

“If someone wants to say RIAB (Ray is a bast—d), I have no problem with that,” Bernoties said. “But ACAB is an unfair attack on all cops including my colleagues, friends I’ve lost, and others who are doing things most will never have to do in their lifetimes,” Bernoties said.

A police sergeant in Oak Bay, B.C., has been demoted and barred from seeking a promotion for one year after he was investigated for corruption, neglect of duty and using intoxicants.

The Oak Bay Police Department was made aware of allegations against then Sgt. Davindar Dalep in October 2020.

The department says it immediately requested an external investigation of the veteran officer from the Office of the Public Complaints Commission (OPCC), the independent office of the B.C. legislature that oversees investigations of municipal police in the province.

""Given the nature of the allegations, the member was assigned to administrative duties and his weapons were seized,"" Oak Bay police Chief Ray Bernoties told CTV News.

The OPCC ordered the Victoria Police Department to investigate the matter and serve as the disciplinary authority in the case.

After more than 15 months, the investigation reached its conclusion on Feb. 2, substantiating allegations of misuse of intoxicants, discreditable conduct, corrupt practice, and two instances of neglect of duty, according to the Oak Bay Police Department.

Dalep, who started with the Oak Bay police in 1998 and was promoted to sergeant in 2017, was sanctioned with a reduction in rank from sergeant to first-class constable. He is prohibited from seeking a promotion for one year and must gain the chief's approval first.

In a phone interview Thursday, the sanctioned officer told CTV News he was fully cooperative with investigators and is relieved to be back on patrol in Oak Bay.

""I had a difficult year and a half and I took responsibility,"" Dalep said. ""I made a mistake and I owned up to it. The police [investigators] did the right job and I'm back to patrol because I did the right things to get back to patrol.""

Bernoties confirmed Dalep has returned to regular duties as a constable under the supervision of a sergeant.

Victoria, BC – Two VicPD Patrol officers were sent to hospital this morning after they were assaulted during an apprehension, and a police-involved collision occurred downtown during the response to this incident.

Shortly after 8 a.m. this morning two VicPD officers attended a suite in a multi-unit residential building in the Jubilee neighbourhood of Victoria to investigate a man with reported mental health concerns who was making threats of violence. After speaking with the man, the officers attempted to apprehend him under the Mental Health Act and were both violently assaulted by the man. The officers deployed oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray and a conductive energy weapon while they were being assaulted. However, both were ineffective. Several other officers attended the scene and assisted in taking the man into custody. The man was transported to hospital for a mental health assessment and to be de-contaminated from OC spray.

The man will face multiple recommended charges of assaulting a police officer.

During the response to the incident a police vehicle collided with another vehicle at the intersection of Douglas and Fisgard streets. The police officer and the driver of the other vehicle involved in the collision suffered non-life-threatening injuries. The driver of the other vehicle, a woman, was transported to hospital.

Northbound traffic on Douglas Street, between Fisgard Street and Pandora Avenue, was closed during the investigation. Traffic has since been re-opened in the area.

File: 21-37601

Victoria, BC – An Integrated Canine Service (ICS) officer suffered non-life-threatening injuries after being head-butted during an arrest early this morning.

Shortly after 2 a.m. this morning VicPD officers were called to the parking lot of a multi-unit temporary housing facility in the 3000-block of Douglas Street for a report of a man kicking the building and smashing glass bottles on the ground. The suspect then left the area. Officers responded to the area and located the suspect in the 2800-block of Douglas Street. However, the suspect fled on bicycle. He was located a short time later in the 500-block of Ellice Street and again fled on a bicycle.

An ICS officer eventually located and arrested the suspect in the 2900-block of Jutland Road after a foot pursuit and a struggle on the ground. The suspect resisted arrest and additional officers were required to take him into custody.

Officers then searched the man near the police vehicle. During the search, the suspect head-butted the ICS officer, causing non-life-threatening injuries. The suspect then spat toward another officer, narrowly missing, while yelling that he was infected with the COVID-19 virus.

The suspect was transported to cells at VicPD where he was later released with a court date and conditions. He will face recommended charges of obstructing a peace officer and assaulting a peace officer.

In British Columbia, the decision to release a person is based on the likelihood they will attend court, the risk posed to public safety, and the impact on confidence in the criminal justice system.  In addition, Bill C-75, which came into effect nationally in 2019, has legislated a “principle of restraint” that requires police to release an accused person at the earliest possible opportunity after considering these factors. This is founded in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that every person has the right to liberty and the presumption of innocence pre-trial.  Police are also asked to consider the circumstances of Indigenous or vulnerable person in the process, in order to address the disproportionate impacts that the criminal justice system has on these populations.

Victoria, BC – Patrol officers arrested a man early this morning after he asked them to help him break into an Automated Teller Machine (ATM).

Two fully uniformed Patrol officers were in the 900-block of Yates Street just after 3 a.m. this morning when they observed a man attempting to break into an ATM. Officers approached the man, noted he had already damaged the machine, and observed his continued efforts to gain access to the ATM for approximately two minutes. At that point the man noted that someone was behind him. Without turning, he asked those behind him to help him break into the ATM.

The officers then identified themselves as police and informed the man he that was under arrest. He attempted to flee.

He was taken to the ground where he fought with officers’ attempts to take him into custody. The Patrol officers called for additional units to attend to assist.

After a brief struggle, the man was placed in handcuffs and then taken to VicPD cells.

The man’s attempts to gain access to the ATM rendered the machine out of order before the officers’ arrival. No one was physically injured in the incident.

The man was released as officers continue their mischief investigation.

 Officers with the Saanich and Victoria police departments will have a larger presence at a South Island gun range this month following an intense shooting that left two suspects dead and six officers injured last week.

The Victoria Police Department says the increased time at the range is part of a ""reintegration"" process for officers who were involved in the incident.

Time at the range allows officers to acclimatize to the sound of gunfire and firearms in a safe environment, according to VicPD. A psychologist is also on hand and participants explore whichever parts of the training they are most interested in.

""The program has been designed to acknowledge that the officer has been through a traumatic event and to provide the opportunity to work through any triggers the event has created, while ensuring the officer is in the safety of a controlled environment,"" said VicPD in a statement Thursday.

 Victoria Fish and Game Protective Association president Douglas Bancroft says police bookings at the range have come up on short notice.

He asked members to check the range reservation system before arriving, in case it is in use.

""The necessity of high levels of firearms training for our police forces has been underscored by this tragic crime,"" said Bancroft in a letter to members on Wednesday.

The Victoria Police Department says the training scheduled at the gun range is intended to reduce the potential for long-term mental health impacts from the shooting.

The program is also based on a world-renowned course created by the Edmonton Police Service, according to VicPD.

""The officers undergoing the training at the range determine the pace and scope of the process, and are supported by their peers for the duration of the training,"" said the police department.

On Tuesday, police said three officers injured in the shooting remain in hospital. Two officers are Saanich police members – including one officer in intensive care – and one officer was a Victoria police member.

A Canadian owned chicken restaurant is expanding to Victoria, with not one but two new locations expected to open this year.

Mary Browns, a Canadian owned fried chicken franchise, has set their sights on two locations, Nelson Square in Esquimalt and the developing Colwood Corners.

Mary Browns began in St. John’s, Newfoundland in 1969. Soon, its reputation for delicious food and Eastern Canada hospitality spread, leading to stores in Ontario and Alberta. 

Now, more than 50 years later, the chicken franchise has over 200 locations across Canada. 

According to the company, Mary Browns is Canada’s largest quick serve chicken restaurant franchise and one of the fastest growing restaurant franchises in the country.

Their menu features signature Canada grade A chicken and taters made from fresh potatoes as well as a variety of other items such as pickle chips, buffalo twists and even some plant based options.

Their food is prepared in-store using their unique breading and batter, as well as their special marinades. 

Their Big Mary sandwich was even named Canada’s best chicken sandwich!

Mary Brown’s first location on Vancouver Island, located in Southgate Shopping Centre in Nanaimo, opened in 2021.

According to the marketing team at Mary Browns, the new location at Nelson Square in Victoria is set to open sometime this summer. 

Although there is no official date for opening the Colwood location, it is predicted it will be open at the end of this year.","Victoria Native Friendship Centre , Victoria Sexual Assault Centre",0,False,5.88235294117647

 Reports of dogs needing to be repeatedly resuscitated after ingesting opioids have prompted two City of Victoria councillors to seek amendments to the city’s Animal Control Bylaw.

Councillors Charlayne Thornton-Joe and Stephen Andrew say there’s been an “alarming increase of reports of animal abuse,” including a case where a dog had to be treated with naloxone seven times. They want changes to allow animal control officers to seize animals they believe have ingested drugs.

 Naloxone, also known as Narcan, reverses the effects of opioids such as morphine and fentanyl. Andrew said he can’t stand by as animals are “cruelly” put through the life-saving intervention — sometimes repeatedly.

The pair plan to propose a new Animal Welfare and the Animal Responsibility Bylaw at committee of the whole on Thursday.

As part of their submission, the councillors noted Portland Housing Society staff at 844 Johnson St., which provides supportive housing, recently informed animal control officers they had to administer three doses of naloxone to a small dog owned by a resident.

Staff said it was the seventh time they had administered naloxone to the dog. They called animal control because the naloxone interventions “exceeded someone’s personal threshold,” animal control officers reported.

Officers seized the dog in the 900 block of Pandora Avenue. A veterinarian found methamphetamine, amphetamine and cocaine in the dog’s urine, according to the councillors. The dog became the city’s property and within days was adopted out.

The councillors say there has been an increase in cases of animal neglect involving drugs. “Animal control officers report a dramatic increase in animal neglect over the past 18 to 24 months,” they say in their submission to the committee.

The councillors recommend the city’s solicitor add language to the Animal Control Bylaw “that stipulates no animal shall be allowed to ingest opioids, narcotics or recreational drugs other than those prescribed by a veterinarian.”

The proposed amendments would require that anyone who treats an animal with naloxone report the incident to animal control and the B.C. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

They would also give animal control officers the ability to seize animals suspected of ingesting of narcotics, recreational drugs or opioids and deliver them to a veterinarian for evaluation and treatment.

The councillors are asking that council request a report from animal control with recommendations to council.","Drugs, Makola Housing Society , Narcotics , Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, Peers Victoria Resources Society , Society of St Vincent De Paul, Sooke Transition House Society",0,False,0.0

Police arrested a man accused of wreaking havoc in downtown Victoria Monday while wearing roller blades and wielding a hockey stick.

Officers were called to the area of Government and Belleville streets shortly after 1:30 p.m. Monday for reports that the man was hitting garbage cans and the windows of a nearby business with a hockey stick.

As officers headed to the area, a third caller reported that the man, on his roller blades, chased her down the sidewalk near Government and Broughton streets.

The woman said the man approached her from behind, pushed the back of her head and stole her toque, then fled on his roller blades. She was not reported injured in the incident.

Officers then tracked down the man to Troune Alley, where he attempted to evade them by roller blading around a police car.

He was eventually caught, taken to the ground and arrested without further incident, and police say he was not injured in the arrest.

FLED will utilize our experience & knowledge helping dogs & their owners north of the Malahat. 
FLED will still post lost/found/wandering/deceased dogs south of the Malahat if reports are sent to us by owners/finders. FLED will still notify authorities & send alerts to our volunteers as we know from experience that the more eyes out there the better it is for the dogs & their owners. 
We will still assist FLED volunteers with advice, posters etc. as required. 
If requested directly, FLED will still physically assist any dog owners south of the Malahat with searching, postering, trapping etc. To be clear, this would mean FLED is lead on finding that owner’s dog.

Although snow has been washed away by rainfalls in recent days, the impact of severe weather coupled with labour shortages and high material volume continues to affect curbside recycling pickup.

Victoria resident Rachelle Lamb, who lives in the Oaklands neighbourhood, said her recycling has been stacking up for weeks.

The last day of pickup in her area was Dec. 15 – she received notices on Dec. 29 and Jan. 12 that recycling would not be collected.

Normally, curbside recycling is scheduled every other Wednesday, Lamb said, and she reached out to the Capital Regional District suggesting they pick up on a Saturday to catch up.

“Since we couldn’t get picked up on the 14-day Wednesday schedule, I would think that we would be next on the list for the next time around, but that never happened,” she said. “I wish it had been treated differently and that issues around scheduling was being addressed – it just feels like it’s being swept under the rug.”

One disruption is a minor annoyance, two disruptions are unfair and point to scheduling issues, she added.

All 10 routes have been impacted by multiple service delays and disruptions related to inclement weather, high material volumes, staffing challenges and equipment repairs over the past several weeks, said Russ Smith, the CRD’s senior manager of environmental resource management.

“Recovery efforts on Saturdays are not possible at this time because the service disruptions are regionwide and not limited to a single route,” he said.

Recovery efforts on alternate weekdays are also not possible right now as redeploying trucks or starting routes late will create more service delays and disruptions for scheduled collection days, he added.

“The CRD is working closely with Emterra, the contractor responsible for material collection, to return the blue box recycling program to normal service levels as quickly as possible.”

Efforts include temporarily bringing in an additional truck and staff from outside the region to support daily collection efforts of higher-than-normal material volumes.

A commentary by a Victoria city councillor.

The City of Victoria is in a ­public-safety crisis. The first step to solving the growing threat to public safety is to acknowledge it as real and take immediate action. If that is not done, it is difficult to see how we can continue to function as a city.

Our police, bylaw and animal-control departments are in crisis. They are understaffed and overworked. The tone from inside these departments is that “we are dropping like flies.”

 The numbers speak for themselves. VicPD has 52 members unable to be deployed due to injury or PTSD, including 17 recruits at the Justice Institute. Hours lost to injury and PTSD tripled since 2018, from 1,051 to 3,361.

It’s getting worse, with assaults on officers, including being knocked unconscious, attacked while volunteering and recently even being struck by a stolen vehicle.

VicPD often runs below minimum staffing numbers for patrol shifts. At one time, ­officers were glad to work overtime, but no more. They are increasingly burnt out and shifts are going unfilled.

The response time for “priority one” calls, such as threat to life or assault, is now 15 minutes.

Chief Del Manak tells council this is “an unacceptable level.” That is an understatement — it is dangerous.

Morale is badly diminished. Numerous sources say from 10 to 18 officers are actively looking to leave VicPD for other departments such as ­Saanich, Oak Bay, Surrey and the RCMP. Several veteran officers recently said they have never seen morale so low.

The union says part of the problem is that VicPD handles more work per officer than any other capital region police department, and those VicPD officers get less pay.

As a front-line officer recently said: “It’s not really about the money. We need ­help. We feel abandoned, underappreciated and everyday face ‘anti-police’ comments. It’s not great right now.”

Throughout the ranks, there is concern that if help doesn’t come soon, surviving the crisis will be next to impossible.

Out of necessity, basic maintenance of public order now rests with city bylaw officers. That department estimates it spends 80 per cent of its time dealing with public safety issues in parks and on the streets, and trying to prevent further encampments.

That leaves little time to deal with a growing list of resident complaints, such as noise, infractions and investigations.

VicPD’s union believes increased provincial shelters and housing programs ­consume much of their resources. Recently the union told the police board that “the situation has become increasingly worse.”

Between June 12 and Sept. 3, the department responded to 2,701 calls for service to these facilities. In comparison, it responded to 973 calls for the entire municipality of Esquimalt.

We all need to step up and advocate that more resources must be allocated to manage the crisis.

The province must take responsibility for downloading the policing and social cost of its housing initiatives onto the city. The province should consider a program such as the Toronto Public Housing one that focuses public safety on supported housing with its own police department, supported by officers who don’t carry guns or tasers.

The province needs to find a way to keep dangerous criminals and repeat serial offenders off our streets and out of the revolving door of crime and arrest and catch and release.

Otherwise, the public is left without hope for improvement, and the police with growing frustration that their work doesn’t matter.

Manak must continue to be bold and courageous and demand what is needed for his department to turn things around. The same goes for the bylaw department.

Council must acknowledge and support our police and bylaw officers while it increases advocacy for mental health and addiction from higher levels of government.

And you must voice your ­support to improve public safety by writing to mayorandcouncil@victoria.ca.

Only if we all work together on this crisis will real change occur.","Addict, Addicted, Encampment, Encampments, front line, front line worker, Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, Peers Victoria Resources Society , Shelter, Social Housing , Social problem , Victoria Sexual Assault Centre, Victoria Women in Need",1,True,25.0

One suspect linked to mail thefts from eight different apartment complexes over the past month has been identified.

Over the course of several weeks, beginning July 4, mailboxes located in lobbies and common areas of those Greater Victoria buildings were broken into. Images from surveillance tapes were released to the public in hopes of identifying a suspect.

A witness saw someone resembling the suspect on Aug. 6 at Uptown and called police.

A member of the Saanich Police Department located the man and arrested the suspect.

The 45-year-old Nanaimo man has a criminal history of similar offenses, according to police.

Police said items found after the arrest were likely used to collect personal information that would later be used to steal identities and commit fraud.

On May 25 2023, the West Shore RCMP responded to a report of a disturbance involving a BC Transit bus and a suspect who was denied entry onto the bus. The disturbance took place near the intersection of Goldstream Rd and Sooke Rd in Colwood.

Police were advised the suspect attempted to board the bus near this location but was denied entry due to the presence of the sword. The suspect then smashed an outside window of the bus before leaving on foot. Frontline officers responded to the area immediately and located the suspect in a nearby parking lot.

The suspect was arrested without further incident. Upon searching the suspect, police also located a replica handgun in the suspect’s waist band. Police determined the sword was plastic but was used in a fashion that appeared real. The suspect was arrested for Possession of a Weapon for a Dangerous Purpose, Possession of a Concealed Weapon, Mischief Under $5000 and Breach of Release Order as he was currently bound by conditions to not possess weapons including firearms.

The suspect who is identified as a 19-year-old male resident of Saanich was held in custody to appear before court on May 26th.

Infamous B.C. legislature wood splitter seized again by RCMP

The infamous wood splitter purchased with taxpayer money that became the symbol of B.C.’s legislature spending scandal has been seized again by the RCMP.

Alan Mullen, chief of staff to B.C. Speaker Daryl Plecas, said police reached out Wednesday about taking the splitter and its associated trailer, and picked the items up Thursday morning.

“[Police] have simply said they would like custody of those items, I mean, obviously we’ve seen from the reports we’ve issued as well as statements those items are part of the investigation,” Mullen told Global News Friday.

The wood splitter was possibly the most eye-catching item on a list of questionable expenses Plecas unearthed in a bombshell 2019 report that eventually cost former legislature clerk Craig James and sergeant-at-arms Gary Lenz their jobs.

The wood splitter was initially seized from James’ Vancouver Island property in 2018 when police began investigating the matter and James and Lenz were — at the time — mysteriously put on leave.

It was later released to the legislature, where it has remained ever since.

“It is still owned by the people of British Columbia, obviously, but right now as part of the investigation the RCMP have taken custody,” said Mullen.

“It hasn’t been used since it’s been on the legislative precinct, there is no need for it on the precinct, there wasn’t when it was purchased and there’s not now.”

The splitter cost $3,200.91 and the trailer was $10,029.60.

In his defence, James said the wood splitter was purchased for “earthquake preparedness and disaster recovery” and could be used to rescue people and also for firewood if there was no heat in the legislature building.

Other items detailed in Plecas’ report included high-end suits and watches, a luggage set, digital subscriptions and travel.

James retired after an independent investigation by former chief justice Beverly McLachlin found he committed administrative misconduct.

That report cleared Lenz of any wrongdoing, but he later retired following another report by former Vancouver deputy police chief Doug LePard that found he had committed an “egregious breach of public trust,” by lying about a 2013 incident where publicly paid-for alcohol was loaded in James’ car.

VICTORIA -- Nine months after a Saanich sporting goods store was heavily damaged by a deliberately set fire, a developer has announced plans for a mixed-use condo development on the site.

The Island Outfitters at 3319 Douglas St. was targeted in an act of arson in the early hours of Jan. 4. The store was closed at the time, no one was injured in the fire and the crime remains unsolved.

On Thursday, Aryze Developments announced it was redeveloping the site and seeking municipal approvals to begin construction on a residential project in the fall of 2022.

 “After a great deal of consideration, we arrived at the conclusion that providing some meaningful housing to a region that’s in dire need was the right thing to do with this property,” said Island Outfitters co-founder Ward Bond in a statement.

“We love the memories and community that were created by the store, but it’s time for us to move on and make room for the next iteration of this space,"" added fellow co-founder Darren Wright. ""We wanted to ensure whoever took over the space would make the best use of it. We have always really respected the innovation and creativity that Aryze brings to each project and it just felt like the best fit.""

Aryze said the development may include a mix of condos and rental homes.

Victoria police impounded at least one vehicle over the weekend amid protests opposed to COVID-19 mandates outside the B.C. legislature.

Police have established ""controlled access points"" in the city's James Bay neighbourhood in an effort to prevent trucks and other large vehicles from blockading streets and creating excess noise around the legislature grounds.

The checkpoints remained in place Monday, restricting access to local vehicles and people with legitimate business in the neighbourhood, such as going to the park or the library.

On Saturday, the driver of a pickup truck was stopped by police at Cook Street and Dallas Road. The driver told police that he lives in James Bay and was going home, according to Victoria police.

However, it appears the driver tried to then gain access to the area around the legislature by cutting through the ""very wet, grassy ground of Beacon Hill Park,"" VicPD spokesperson Bowen Osoko told CFAX 1070 on Monday.

The driver had been issued a ""level one"" notice for his vehicle the previous week, Osoko said. A level one notice requires the immediate removal of a vehicle from the road until the vehicle is fixed in compliance with the Motor Vehicle Act and Regulations, according to provincial law.

The truck became stuck in the grass of Beacon Hill Park and had to be towed away.

The driver was handed $600 in fines, the truck was impounded and the licence plates were seized, VicPD said.

The move to limit access to James Bay and the B.C. legislature comes as organizers and supporters of the self-described ""Freedom Convoy"" that occupied downtown Ottawa for several weeks continue to promise a similar occupation in Victoria.

Victoria police described these tactics as having ""a significant and unlawful impact"" on residents and businesses in the James Bay neighbourhood.

B.C.'s capital city has seen ""eight weeks of continuous disruptions involving vehicles, 'slow-roll' blockades and the use of horns, including modified air train and ship horns,"" Victoria police said in a statement Saturday, alluding to the solidarity protests that have been held at the legislature since the Freedom Convoy began.

""Related protest events in other cities have seen a recent escalation in events, including confrontations between protest groups and confrontations with police,"" VicPD said.

"" Victoria’s problems turn away visitors

I have been visiting beautiful Victoria for decades and enjoying the weather, the gardens and the people.

However, I have noticed a decline in the city’s quaintness and beauty — an increase in homeless people, beggars on the street, and people struggling with illegal drug addiction. It’s a turn-off to residents and tourists alike.

 Victoria has taken on a seediness that I wouldn’t have recognized a few years ago. Cruise ships advertise “quaint,” not “homelessness.”

It’s disgusting to walk down Pandora. And frightening. Evil-smelling. And sad.

Yesterday, I saw a man half-undressed lying, perhaps unconscious, on the sidewalk; another shooting up against the brick wall of a church; and dozens of others in various states of drug-induced stupor.

There’s plenty of leering and begging and abusive language, as well.

It’s unacceptable. I don’t understand how you allow it. I do feel sorry for these people and I understand the clinics that help them are downtown and are no doubt doing their best to deal with the problems.

Of course there is mental illness. So — deal with it! In a manner that helps the homeless, drug addicts, mentally ill and the tourists, families, and shopkeepers.

Suggestions: move the help centres to areas that tourists and children don’t populate. Additional steps — look at Finland for an example on how to deal with homelessness. Help the homeless — fight mental illness and drug addiction.

Keep it off the streets!

VictoriaBC,InValensName,"UVic expert weighs in on why drinking in parks and beaches in Victoria is a bad idea https://www.victoriabuzz.com/2021/07/uvic-expert-weighs-in-on-why-drinking-in-parks-and-beaches-in-victoria-is-a-bad-idea/

One positive that came out of the pandemic was the relaxed relationship between bylaw enforcement and alcohol — off-sales became the norm and drinking in parks became more accepted.

But one UVic expert is saying it’s not all it’s cracked up to be.

This week, Vancouver launched its own alcohol in parks pilot project, and in light of that researchers at UVic’s Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research (CISUR) reported that drinking in public is actually bad for public health in the long run.

Led by director Dr. Tim Naimi, the evidence-based, public-health-oriented report is a guide for municipalities as they consider allowing drinking in public outdoor spaces.

Below, Dr. Naimi shares his opinion on why or why not the above is a good idea:
Why isn’t it a good idea to allow drinking in public spaces like parks and beaches?

According to Dr. Naimi, the negative physiological health effects of alcohol, the second-hand effects of alcohol, like violence, and the taxation it puts on municipalities to monitor alcohol-consumption and waste, are the guiding factors in not allowing drinking in public.
How will allowing alcohol consumption in these kinds of public spaces help restaurants and pubs?

Because hospitality-based businesses including restaurants and pubs have taken such a hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing drinking in public spaces could hurt them, according to Dr. Naimi.

He said that because people who want to drink outside their homes could now purchase the cheaper alcohol from liquor stores and just drink in municipal spaces instead of patronizing restaurants and pubs, it would further divert business away from those establishments.
Why is it important to provide this guidance on drinking in public municipal spaces now?

“There’s been a sense of urgency to make things better for people in response to the pandemic. I think allowing alcohol consumption in public spaces like parks, beaches and city plazas is a well-intentioned but misguided effort to do that,” said Dr. Naimi.

“We should remember the COVID-19 pandemic will hopefully be ending soon, and the decisions that we rush into now may become permanent fixtures in our social landscape—and will not necessarily change them for the better when it comes to community health outcomes.”
Suggestions

Overall, Dr. Naimi and the report suggests not to permit consuming alcohol in public, but if municipalities decide to go that route, they have recommendations:

    Governments engagement with citizens.
    Keep these initiatives temporary and/or seasonal rather than permanent.
    Keep drinking to restricted times of day and areas within the municipal property.
    Legal advice about their municipal liability.
    Municipalities should encourage people to purchase food and alcohol from nearby restaurants, pubs and food trucks.
    Increase budgets for extra costs incurred by governments such as for bylaw enforcement or trash pickup.","Alcoholic , Community Plan to End Homelessness , Substance use, Violence",0,False,36.36363636363637

Victoria -

Two Vancouver Island police departments say the province will no longer pay for their naloxone supplies — a life-saving medication officers use frequently, in the midst of the overdose crisis.

A high-ranking officer with the Oak Bay Police Department (OBPD) said B.C.’s Public Safety Ministry notified police agencies of the funding cut in April of last year.

""Inventories are now expiring, so police departments are now contemplating how to best manage this,"" Oak Bay Police Chief Ray Bernoties wrote in an email to CTV News.

 ""OBPD views this as a serious issue, as our members do encounter overdoses,"" he said. ""There are other [police departments] who will likely experience an even greater impact.""

The Saanich Police Department said its naloxone kits expire at the end of the year. The department will replenish its own supply.

""Which is… obviously a significant cost,"" said Saanich Police Const. Markus Anastasiades.

""However, we know that they’re vital for saving lives and we want our officers to have it at their disposal,"" he said.

The Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General has not confirmed the funding cut. CTV News is awaiting a response.

In the first half of this year, at least 1,011 people died of a suspected drug overdose, according to the provincial coroner’s service. B.C.’s Health Ministry declared overdose deaths a public health emergency in 2016.

Victoria, BC – Investigators have seized a vehicle closely resembling the vehicle that struck a young woman at Bay and Blanshard streets yesterday.

Just after 10 p.m. last night, VicPD Patrol officers located a vehicle closely resembling the vehicle involved in the collision. A member of the public who had seen the video of the collision online recognized the vehicle, located it and called police.

Patrol officers attended, noted damage consistent with a recent collision, and seized the vehicle. It was towed to VicPD’s secure storage area for processing by our Forensic Identification Section officers who are working with VicPD’s Collision Reconstruction Team investigators to determine if this vehicle was involved in the collision.

There have been no arrests.

Officers were called to the intersection of Bay and Blanshard streets just after 9 a.m. yesterday morning after a pedestrian was struck while crossing at the intersection. The young woman was crossing the street, in the cross walk, with the light, when she was struck by a vehicle travelling northbound that failed to stop for the red light. The driver of the vehicle continued through the intersection, narrowly avoiding additional collisions with other vehicles. The driver of the vehicle did not stop.

The incident was captured on video which was shared on VicPD’s Twitter, Facebook and Instagram pages as well as VicPD.ca.

Members of the public shared the video widely. The member of the public who recognized the vehicle saw the video shared online and followed up with police.

The young woman who was struck by the vehicle was released from hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. She lost her mobile phone in the collision. If you located a mobile phone in the area of Bay and Blanshard streets yesterday morning, please call (250) 995-7654 extension 1 so we can return it to her. She continues to recover.

Investigators are still hoping to speak with the driver of the Tesla Model Y that was making the left hand turn onto Blanshard Street as they may have additional video of the vehicle involved and information about the incident.

Several people on scene came to the young woman’s aid, including the people who supplied the dashcam video which has been key to our ongoing investigation. While not captured on video, they exited their vehicle when safe to do so, provided first aid and comfort, remained on scene until officers arrived and provided timely access to crucial video evidence. Additional people in the area, including a City of Victoria employee and a driver of a vehicle nearly struck in the collision, all rushed to the young woman’s aid. Officers are thanking all of these people for their help.

This investigation remains ongoing. If you are the driver of the vehicle involved, have footage of the collision, or have information about the incident and have yet to speak with investigators, please call the VicPD Report Desk at (250) 995-7654, extension 1.

VictoriaBC,InValensName,"Vic West shelter resident loses housing after arson arrest https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/vic-west-shelter-resident-loses-housing-after-arson-arrest-1.24319774

A resident of a newly opened shelter in Vic West has lost his housing after an arrest for arson, and the incident underscores the need for complex care housing, says a spokesperson for Our Place Society.

Victoria police said they arrested a man for arson in relation to a fire Saturday evening that damaged a business a block away from a temporary shelter on Russell Street. Police said the man was arrested at the shelter, which is managed by Our Place and opened two weeks ago to house people sheltering in city parks.

The Victoria Fire Department said they were notified of a dumpster on fire against a building at 320 Mary St. around 6 p.m. Saturday. Firefighters arrived to find the fire had spread to the business, with heavy smoke and flames coming from the front of the building. Crews quickly extinguished the flames, but estimated the cost of the damage at $400,000. There was no one inside at the time.

Grant McKenzie, communications director for Our Place, said the non-profit is “extremely disappointed” by the incident. They do not make the decision to remove someone from housing lightly, but they have a zero tolerance policy for crime, he said, and safety for residents and neighbours is a top priority.

“Last night, there were 29 other people in that shelter who had a good night’s sleep because housing was available for them. We can’t jeopardize that,” McKenzie said.

Outreach workers, who can provide help filling out applications for housing, detox, identification, returning to school or finding work, do not have the training to help people with complex mental health needs, McKenzie said.

The needs of someone who sets fire to property are “such a step above a local charity providing housing,” he said.

“It shows that there’s such a gap that we’re missing, you know. So this person has been arrested for arson, and the way the system seems to be working, he’ll probably be released this afternoon or tomorrow. And he’ll be released back onto the street, because there is no place to put him,” McKenzie said. “There is no place of complex care that can look into what’s causing this.”

The mayors of B.C.’s 13 largest municipalities, including Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps, have urged the province to create complex-care housing where people with severe mental health challenges can receive intensive help.

The Russell Street shelter features 60 individual pods with a single bed and bedside table, with three-and-a-half short walls around the unit. Capacity is capped at 30 people while the air circulation system is being tested to ensure safety during the pandemic.

Our Place staff have already seen the effects moving indoors can have on new residents in the shelter. One woman made the move to detox just a week after settling into her own pod from a tent in a nearby park, said Cathy Mingo, manager of housing and shelter for Our Place. She had tried to enter the program several times before, but hadn’t stayed for more than a night, Mingo said.

“She didn’t feel safe, comfortable, supported enough to go. So just being at Russell Street for that one week, she felt confident enough to try and detox herself,” she said.

Mingo said she has watched residents of other supportive housing sites managed by Our Place move on to their own housing, reconnect with family, go back to school to earn a high school diploma and start jobs for the first time in years.","Complex care , front line worker, Makola Housing Society , Our Place, Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, Peers Victoria Resources Society , Shelter, Society of St Vincent De Paul, Sooke Transition House Society, Temporary housing , Temporary shelter",1,True,25.0

Investigators Appeal For Calm As Man Held In Custody After Animal Injury Charges Sworn

File: 20-3064

Victoria, BC – Investigators are appealing for calm as a Victoria man remains in custody after being arrested in a January 20th incident involving an animal in Victoria’s Oaklands neighbourhood.

Patrol officers were called to a multi-unit residential building in the 1300-block of Hillside Avenue at approximately 4 p.m. on January 20th, for a report of an incident between a man and a dog. When officers arrived, they discovered that the man had left the scene and had gone into a suite in the building. Officers discovered that the dog was deceased.

Patrol officers, as well as Saanich Police Department K9 and VicPD K9 officers responded to the scene.

The man refused to leave the suite and the Greater Victoria Emergency Response Team (GVERT), including Crisis Negotiators, were deployed. Residents of neighbouring suites were evacuated out of an abundance of caution. Attempts were made to negotiate with the man, but he was not cooperative.

Just before 7 p.m. the man exited the suite, but refused to comply with officers’ directions. ARWEN less-lethal projectiles were deployed and the man was then taken into custody without further incident. He was transported to hospital by B.C.

The investigation revealed that the man was not the owner of the dog. The dog’s owners reported that the dog had been taken from their residence in a break and enter which occurred a short time before officers were called to the incident in the 1300-block of Hillside Avenue. The dog’s owners were not home at the time of the break and enter, but returned home to discover evidence of the break and enter and their dog missing.

Investigators have confirmed the deceased dog was the same dog taken from the residence.

https://www.cheknews.ca/victoria-council-delays-decision-on-clover-point-parking-loop-743242/

Victoria city councillors have voted to delay a decision on whether to replace Clover Point’s parking loop with a new pedestrian public park.

Council spent almost an hour debating the issue Thursday, tossing out a variety of ideas on whether to eliminate, shrink, halve or retain the current loop of 90 parking spaces, before ultimately deferring a decision and asking city staff to develop new options by Feb. 25.

“I’m losing the plot,” Mayor Lisa Helps said at one point while trying to wrangle a variety of competing visions, amendments and sub-amendments on the park’s future.

“I think we are trying to design on the fly.”

Coun. Ben Isitt said he was in favour of the staff recommendation to eliminate the parking loop, create a new park and build 13 new parking spaces as well as four accessible parking spaces. But he asked staff to increase that to as many as 10 accessible parking spaces in future designs.

Isitt also proposed a 12-month review of council’s decision, which was later changed to a six-month review before council voted to make no decision at all.

“We’ve tried a certain design for about 65 years and I think trying a slightly different design for a few months or years wouldn’t be a bad thing for the community,” said Isitt.

“And if we find we’re unable to effectively manage parking issues with the proposed design there’s a number of options to address those.”

Coun. Sarah Potts floated the idea of a half loop, in which the west side was closed to vehicles but the east side remained open to waterfront parking. The proposal picked up some support, but Isitt and staff warned about potential safety risks of mingling cars and pedestrians so closely together.

Coun. Geoff Young suggested a smaller parking loop, which would still allow some cars but also have additional pavement available for cyclists and pedestrians.

Young also responded to public complaints about the often cold wind and weather making the park undesirable for sustained public gatherings by proposing an open shelter of some type to act as a windbreak.

“This park is not balanced now between pedestrians and automobiles,” said Young “It is far too automobile-oriented and I think we do need to restore the balance somewhat.”

Coun. Charlayne Thornton-Joe said she did not support the city staff’s idea to eliminate the parking loop, noting for many, including herself, the current design allows for people to drive up to the waterfront and sit and enjoy the ocean in a different way.

She said the staff idea “went a little bit too far.”

“There are so many reasons why people don’t get out of their car there,” she said. “But one of their joys is to enjoy the view.”

City staff told the council that a two-week delay to come up with new options that include a mix of parking, pedestrian space and more accessible parking stalls would not jeopardize any potential savings compared to making a decision Thursday.

The idea to permanently close Clover Point’s parking loop first came from city staff late last month with a report that recommended making the change during ongoing sewage treatment construction at the site.

Staff called for the elimination of 90 parking spots in favour of a community green space with seating, benches and public art, as well as 13 new parking spots at the top of the loop, four accessible spots and a loading zone for dropping off passengers.

The idea proved contentious, with disability and seniors advocates warning it might be harder for those with mobility issues to access the park without the ability to drive to the water. Others embraced the idea of transforming a parking lot into a more versatile gathering space for people, pets and families.

The loop parkway was created in the 1950s, billed as a way to allow drivers to park at the water’s edge.

The parking has been closed for the past year while the Capital Regional District upgrades the Clover Point pump station, located directly below, as part of the region’s new sewage treatment system.",Shelter,1,True,18.181818181818183

The Victoria Police Department says they’ve arrested a woman who allegedly set grass fires in Beacon Hill Park, attempted to steal a vehicle and broke into a home to take a shower.

Police say they were called for a report that a woman was using a small torch to light sections of grass on fire near the 200-block of Simcoe Street just after 5:30 p.m. Sunday, while several members of the public reportedly followed behind, extinguishing the fires before they spread.

The woman was found sitting near a van by the first officer to arrive to the area who recognized her on a warrant from Duncan, police say.

When the officer tried to take her into custody, she allegedly attempted to fight back before leaping into the nearby van and trying to drive away.

The officer then deployed pepper spray, affecting both of them, and the woman fled, according to police.

Police then say a person flagged down officers arriving on scene in the 200-block of Douglas Street, saying they fled their suite with their dog after a woman broke in, stole clothing from a bedroom closet and then went to take a shower in the bathroom.

While following up on the report and investigating the suite, officers found the woman in the bathroom taking a shower.

She was taken into custody without incident.

Police say the woman, who was wanted on a warrant based in Duncan, was also awaiting disposition on charges related to assault on staff at a temporary housing facility and addition charges, breaking and entering, attempted theft of a vehicle, flight from police and resisting arrest.

She was held for court Monday morning and now faces additional charges of arson, breaking and entering, attempted theft of a vehicle, flight from police and resisting arrest.

Police are now asking members of the public who have information on the incident and who have not spoken to them to call 250-995-7654 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.","Home, Temporary housing , Theft",1,False,16.666666666666664
VictoriaBC,InValensName,"Victoria pulls out of mutual-aid agreement for fighting fires https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/victoria-pulls-out-of-mutual-aid-agreement-for-fighting-fires-1.24206008

 The City of Victoria is pulling out of a 40-year-old mutual-aid agreement to provide fire ­service to Esquimalt, Saanich and Oak Bay over concerns ­ that other municipalities are calling on Victoria more than it calls on them for help, at ­taxpayers’ expense.

Victoria’s mayor and fire chief both say the fire department is still willing to help its neighbours, but they want those neighbours to pay for it.

 “I think it’s just fair that people pay for the service they’re using,” Mayor Lisa Helps said Friday.

Since 2016, Victoria Fire has assisted Oak Bay Fire 21 times and Esquimalt Fire three times, but has not called on those municipalities for help. Victoria Fire has assisted Saanich Fire four times and called on Saanich seven times.

The move to withdraw from the agreement rankled mayors from Esquimalt, Saanich and Oak Bay, who say they were blindsided by the decision.

“To be honest, we were surprised and I have to say a little bit disappointed,” said Saanich Mayor Fred Haynes, who said he expects a third-party mediator will have to get involved to sort out the dispute.

Esquimalt Mayor Barb Desjardins said her municipality would not agree to pay Victoria Fire for services in Esquimalt, as mutual-aid agreements are driven by public safety.

“What I have heard from our staff is that we have no interest in doing a fee-for-service [model],” Desjardins said. “This is about being there for each other as required.”

Esquimalt has mutual-aid agreements with fire departments in Saanich, Oak Bay and View Royal, as well as the Department of National Defence, which covers CFB Esquimalt, and none are based on a fee-for-service model, Desjardins said.

In an Aug. 31 letter to the three mayors, Helps said the City of Victoria intends to pull out of the 1980 mutual-aid agreement within 120 days. Helps said she wants to develop a new agreement that’s based on a cost-recovery strategy that will allow fire departments to bill other departments if they provided mutual aid.

Oak Bay Mayor Kevin Murdoch said Oak Bay Fire, which has one engine truck, often calls on other fire departments for backup in case a fire gets out of control.

Murdoch speculated that Victoria has intentionally not called on its neighbours for mutual aid “just to make this point.”

“I’m not sure that serves the safety of the region,” he said.

Victoria Fire first raised the mutual-aid-agreement renewal in 2015, but since then, negotiations have stalled.

“For three years, they haven’t really come to the table, opened up the books and said: ‘Let’s have a look,’ ” Haynes said.

Helps admits that since 2015, the negotiations have “gone around in circles a little bit. Through everyone’s best efforts, it hasn’t been resolved.”

The breakdown in negotiations comes amid a backdrop of failed talks between Greater Victoria fire departments to establish a centralized dispatch service for fire calls. In 2018, Esquimalt, Colwood, View Royal, Sidney and North Saanich contracted with a dispatch service in Surrey after they balked at an increase in fees for Saanich’s fire dispatch centre.

Desjardins said Esquimalt offers important public-safety services to Victoria Fire, and could provide quick access to an emergency in Vic West if the community was somehow cut off via the Bay Street, Johnson Street or Craigflower bridges.

Victoria Fire Chief Paul Bruce said the fire department would never turn down a request for help — it just wants to be compensated when it does lend its services.

“If we’re going to provide firefighting service or rescue services to another municipality, it seems reasonable to me that those costs should be recouped,” he said. “I feel obligated to the taxpayers of Victoria that there should be some equitable compensation.”

Many fire departments on the Lower Mainland use a fee-for-service model, Bruce said. An an example, he said sending one engine with two firefighters would cost $250, which is reasonable for any fire department.

Helps said withdrawing from the agreement has nothing to do with “being good neighbours or bad neighbours.”

“It has to do with fairness and equity and making sure when we’re providing service, we’re compensated for it.”","Point in Time, Service provider , Victoria Native Friendship Centre , Victoria Sexual Assault Centre",1,False,75.0

 The City of Victoria is soliciting proposals from groups interested in operating a free ""bike valet"" in the city's downtown this summer.

A request for proposals posted on the city's website seeks submissions from ""qualified proponents"" who can ""provide, operate, promote, maintain and evaluate a bicycle valet pilot project"" in the downtown core.

The idea, according to the document, is to provide “enhanced bicycle parking options” downtown, which the city hopes will prevent theft of and damage to parked bikes and encourage more people to choose active transportation options.

""The service would be offered to the public free of charge and designed to improve the confidence, convenience and overall experience for people using active transportation,"" project description reads.

 The city is offering space in the Undercroft, under the antechamber at City Hall in Centennial Square, for the successful applicant to operate the valet service. Pitches to locate the service on a privately owned outdoor space in the downtown core will also be considered, according to the project's terms of reference.

""This RFP is focused on offering a 'coat check' style valet service that consists of a staffed, secured area with established operating hours for bicycle parking,"" the document reads.

""The service must accommodate bicycles (including e-bikes, cargo bikes, recumbent and/or other types of adaptive bicycles), personal mobility scooters, walkers, strollers, and skateboards. Other personal transportation mobility devices may be serviced at the Proponent’s discretion.""

Whoever is selected to operate the program will be provided with city-branded tents and other materials, including fencing, tables and chairs, and signage.

No third-party advertising will be allowed, and no fees can be charged for the bike valet service. Tips can be accepted, but the operator cannot require or ""actively encourage"" them.

The successful applicant will need to collect monthly data on how many personal transportation vehicles are stored and their types, the average length of time they're stored for, the number of bikes registered with Project 529, and the number of voluntary tips received. 

The operator will also need to provide a final report to the city that includes ""quantitative and qualitative indicators, including number and frequency of repeat users, average wait length time for dropping off and picking up bikes, user satisfaction, descriptions of any lessons learned and recommendations for future valet services,"" according to the request for proposals.

The city says the service must operate until at least Oct. 31, and its preferred start date is no later than June 15.

Those interested in operating the bike valet service have until noon on May 5 to submit their proposals via the city's online portal. https://victoria.bonfirehub.ca/opportunities/52507","Service provider , Tent, Theft, Victoria Women in Need",1,False,28.57142857142857

Appeals by Victoria Police Department (VicPD) to avoid large groups in the face of COVID-19 met with indifference, even defiance Saturday night.

Officers responding to a noise complaint in Esquimalt Saturday night discovered a house party. Officers then told party-goers to go home in explaining the dangers of such gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Bowen Osoko, department spokesperson.

“Some of the party-goers were undeterred, mistakenly believing their youth made them ‘immune’ to the virus,” he said. Police, however, did to make any arrests, he added.

VicPD did not release any information about the size of house party, nor any specifics about its physical environment.

Osoko stressed the “vital importance” of “social and physical distancing” as a precaution in the fight against the pandemic, pointing to appeals from British Columbia’s top doctor, Dr. Bonnie Henry, who has also used her powers to take several steps in slowing down the spread of the virus.

They include banning gatherings of more than 50 people, closing dine-in services at all restaurants and securing supply chains and vital supplies. Yesterday, Henry added to these measures by ordering the closure of hair salons, massage therapists and tattoo artists.

Municipalities around Greater Victoria have also closed public buildings, cancelled public gatherings and closed playgrounds.

Henry Saturday announced 76 new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 424 cases in British Columbia, with 230 cases in Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, 126 cases in Fraser Health Authority, 37 cases in Vancouver Island Health Authority, 27 cases in Interior Health Authority and four cases in Northern Heath Authority.

Ten people have now died of COVID-19 in British Columbia.

The province remains in state of emergency.

Steve O’Neill knows too well the struggle in finding a family doctor in Greater Victoria.

“They told me to call first thing in the morning at 9 a.m.,” said the Sidney resident. “They said if you call at 9:01, the phones will be closed because all the appointments will be full for the day.”

According to their website, Shoreline Medical’s two locations receive approximately 8,000 calls per day.

O’Neill moved to Sidney from the U.S. a year and a half ago where he said he lived at times with and without medical insurance, yet never found it this hard to find a physician.

“You know I’ve never experienced anything like this where it’s like you’re trying to get a ticket to the rolling stones to get an appointment, that’s not something I’ve remotely experienced in the states, ever.”

O’Neill says he’s more frustrated for his aunt who’s 93 years old, doesn’t have a family doctor, and was relies on emergency room visits for her health care needs.

“She waited a very long time and she’s older and she couldn’t understand why we were there so long,” said O’Neill. “That was very challenging.”

With a handful of Greater Victoria family doctors recently announcing their departure from primary care, one Victoria doctor tells CHEK News that a surge in demand is adding more strain to the already severe family doctor crisis.

“It’s a perfect storm,” said Dr. Matthew Ward, director of the Eagle Creek Medical Clinic in View Royal. “I think it’s getting worst.”

Ward believes costs associated with running a practice are deterring family doctors from staying in primary care.

“We need to incentivize a large number of those family doctors who have licenses in BC to come back into community-based family practice, to create medical homes for our patients.”

Meanwhile, O’Neill has already written several letters to elected officials and says he won’t stop anytime soon.

“The political will just doesn’t seem to be there, and that to me is the real problem.”

The Ministry of Health told CHEK News in a statement that they are in active discussions with the Victoria and South Island Primary Care Networks, as well as with the Doctors of BC on actions that may be taken in the interim to stabilize local clinics.

The Ministry adds that more than $70 million has been invested to improve primary care in Victoria and that they aim to support around 126,000 more patients in the Greater Victoria area over the next several years.","Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness , Victoria Women in Need",0,True,0.0

VictoriaBC,InfiNorth,"As a heads up, there are plans to close the Gordon Head Walk-In Clinic. This is the only clinic available North of McKenzie avenue, and I have confirmed that there are no doctors in the CRD accepting patients. As with all walk-in clinics, you have to line up as much as an hour in advance. Due to GPs being underpaid and mistreated in Canada, the clinic has lost six doctors in the last two years. As a result, they aren't bringing in enough funding to stay open and it has nothing to do with demand. They turned away eight people *while I was waiting alone,* which was only for two hours of the five hours they were open today. 

Unfortunately these walk-in clinics are the only choices for many people, including the elderly, the disabled, and those with a low privilege. The big problem with this is that they are in-person, first-come-first-serve. The further away one of these clinics is, the faster you have to get there to be in line as the sun rises. Many people do not have that ability, as if you have limited funds you can't take a cab and you probably don't have a car to drive to the next one, several kilometres away. While I praise our bus system, for many, it just isn't an option for going the longer distances. 

There is currently a petition in their waiting room to improve funding and keep the clinic open. There will be no walk-in clinic to the North of Hillside to the East of Uptown, meaning that people have to travel *at least* an additional 2.5km to get medical treatment. I'm not impressed at the declining state of our healthcare, and our government really needs to fix how it treats doctors.",Healthcare ,1,True,50.0

VictoriaBC,InfiNorth,"There are some amazing places to visit in the CRD that you don't need a car to get to, including campgrounds. I've made a small list and I'll update it as suggestions are posted! #Hiking

* **East Sooke Park:** Incredible short (and long) hikes (via the Galloping Goose or via the 64 East Sooke, which is sadly very infrequent).

* **Sooke Hills:** Mountain biking, hiking, swimming including mountain lakes (via the Galloping Goose Trail and/or the 61/65 Sooke stopping at Harbour view Road) Sadly as of 2018, Sooke Mountain Provincial Park no longer permits backcountry camping - it was the last transit-accessible backcountry camping in the CRD. 

* **Goldstream Provincial Park:** via the Humpback Connector or the various buses into Goldstream. Access between the campground area and the core parking lot at the estuary is technically non-existent. Technically. 

* **Gowlland Tod Provincial Park:** You could hike the park for a week and still discover new little trails (via any transit bus serving the Butchart Gardens, get off at the stop just outside the gardens and enter the park via Tod Inlet. A few small trails cross the creek into the mountain fjordland of the main core of the park)

* **TLAU WELNEW - John Dean Park:** Great hiking and views of the islands (via the 72, 87 or even the 85)

* **Thetis Lake:** Take the Six Mile Road exit off the Galloping Goose. Main beach just past the vehicle parking lot has bike parking. A lot of trails that go as far as Mount Work if you're feeling super ambitious. Thetis Lake is also transit accessible from the 53.

* **Elk/Beaver Lake:** Take Sayward Rd. from the Lochside, walk your bike across the Pat Bay Highway as a pedestrian, then turn left on Hamsterly Rd. to find Hamsterly Beach and bike parking. Same area is transit accessible via the 70/72/75.

* **PKOLS:** Take Lohbrunner Rd from the Lochside, left on Blenkinsop, parking lot on the right. I can't recall if there are bike racks, though. PKOLS can also be accessed from the east side with transit via the 39. Alternatively, take the Mt. Douglas Greenway up to Glendenning Road for a less... vertical experience.

SIGHTSEEING (just an idea)

* **The Gardens at HCP:** Pretty easy to get to via the Colquitz River Trail, accessed right by the Galloping Goose at Interurban Road. Bus 83 also goes directly there!

* **Southern Gulf Islands:** BC Ferries access is actually pretty easy on a bike. The Lochside goes all the way there, with a bike entrance to the terminal off Dolphin Road. Transit, of course, has tons of double-decker buses (70/71/72, 80-series if you live on the Peninsula). Salt Spring has transit provided by BC Transit. Mayne has a volunteer bus. Pender Island has no bus service.

* **Fort Rodd Hill/Hatley Castle Gardens/Esquimalt Lagoon:** All in the same area. Head west on the Galloping Goose. If you're headed to Hatley, continue to University Drive, then follow the (insanely fun big) hill all the way down to the parking lot. If you're headed to Fort Rodd/Esquimalt Lagoon, just past Island Highway, keep an eye on your left for a gate in a fence. This leads to some older condos and Virago Crescent. Go to the end, left, end again, right, end again, left, end again, right, and you should be on Belmont Road. Follow Belmont to the end, keeping right, and you'll find a wooded path that leads you to Ocean Blvd. Walk your bike across and left (**careful of vehicles on the road**) to get to Fort Rodd Hill, or fly down the hill like a madperson for Esquimalt Lagoon. Keep in mind you'll have to ride/walk back up though

* **Abkhazi Garden&& is easy to bus (61) and is an absolute gem. I love visiting gardens on vacation and it is one of my absolute favourites out of the many I have been to. Gorgeous garden, absolutely lovely backstory, and fabulous tea.

#Camping

* **Sooke Potholes Campground** via the Galloping Goose Trail

* **Islandview Beach Regional Park** via the Lochside Trail 

* **Goldstream Provincial Park** via the Humpback Connector

* **SMONECTEN (formerly MacDonald Park) Campground, Gulf Islands National Park Reserve of Canada** via the 71, 72 or Lochside Trails

* **Prior Centennial Campground,** North Pender Island (via 70, 71, 72, or Lochside Trail, and BC Ferries) biking 

* **Narvaez Bay,** Saturna Island. Walk- or bike-in camping only (via BC Ferries)

* **Sidney Island** via the Alpine foot ferry. Walk-in camping. Parks Canada provides wagons to transport your gear from the dock to the camping area. 

* **Discovery Island, D'Arcy Island, and others** are accessible by water taxi, kayak, canoe, paddle board and other water transportation - but be aware that our local waters are insanely dangerous for novices due to the ridiculous currents. *Protip: overnight parking at Oak Bay Marina is permissible, making it ideal as a launching spot for Discovery Island.*

* **Ruckle Park** by bike via the Lochside Trail and BC Ferries service to Salt Spring Island. 

* **Montague Harbour Provincial Park.** This one is a bit weird. There is no public transit on Galliano Island, but there is a pub bus. Hit up the pub and then pitch your tent after getting off the ferry.

VictoriaBC,InfiNorth,"This city - and this province in general - is plagued with insane levels of road safety problems caused by zero enforcement. What are we supposed to do about it? **Edit:** I love that ""gee maybe people should follow the law when driving"" is a controversial issue.

-------------------------------------------------------------- 

Victoria may not be the worst (having just been in Vancouver recently) but our roads are a death trap because of the way drivers choose to operate their vehicles.

Everyone speeds. Everyone. Buses, city vehicles, the bloody cops. Hell, ebikes are even starting to speed through school zones. Running red lights is a normal Tuesday - and I'm talking about from a dead standstill. No right turn on red isn't even a suggestion, it's like it's just ignored. No honouring of pedestrians at marked or unmarked crosswalks. Driving and parking in bike and bus lanes. Blocking crosswalks at lights. Insanely agressive tailgating. No turn signals. Douchebags in lifted trucks literally driving on the sidewalk to get to the right turn lane three seconds earlier. Stop signs? What is a stop sign? Doesn't that just mean ""fly through after briefly tapping your brakes?""

And how much meaningful enforcement? None. Not a smidge. When it does happen, the news calls it a ""blitz,"" talks about how they either ran out of tickets to hand out or straight up gave up because of infractions overwhelming the officers assigned to their roadblocks and checkpoints... And then just go back to business as usual as if that is totally fine and this isn't indicative of a major systemic issue that needs immediate resolution. They never stop and think *hey, maybe this is an indicator that we need to devote more resources to road safety.* 

Then there are commercial vehicles - from taxis to district maintenance trucks to LCVs, speeding, unsecure loads, aggressive driving, running lights. Again, CVSE does these ""blitzes"" where they manage to impound like 80 commercial vehicles at one checkpoint in under an hour... And consider that a successful day *instead of treating it as an indicator that they are aassive failure of enforcement for letting things get to this point.*

I'm a driver. I'm a cyclist for both recreation and everyday transport. I take the bus. I walk. ***I literally never feel safe on our roads.*** ICBC does stupid shit like hand out high-visibility armbands and encourage eye contact despite that being proven time and again to have no impact on safety. When people are killed or injured by motor vehicles the offending driver is congratulated for *literally not fleeing the scene and obstructing justice* (""the driver remained present and cooperated"") while the victims are blamed for any tiny thing that can be pinned on them - dark clothing, wrong time of day, walking on the wrong side of the street, no eye contact, acting unpredictable, not waiting their turn, walking too fast, walking too slow, wearing sunglasses... 

I am honestly getting pissed off at how we have just let safety when operating motor vehicles go to the wayside. The police don't give half a shit - they literally hang up on you if you call in vehicles blocking bike lanes and they didn't witness it themselves.

What the hell are we supposed to do about this, especially as we now see, based on recent interactions, that the police see themselves as being above and independent of any form of direction from local government? Who do you complain to? The cops ignore us. Hell they will arrest you for complaining too often for ""wasting their resources"" - I can't get into details but this is something I have watched happen. When serious incidents occur they do *nothing.* Local government has *no* leash on out-of-control bloated police departments. IRSU is a joke. Our roads are a death trap and the vehicles on them are getting bigger and more dangerous for anyone not in the vehicles... And our government is making no indication of ever making meaningful investment into giving people an alternative to driving everywhere other than rebranding an existing bus route.

VictoriaBC,InvisibleComitte,"Pacific Rim College: the Good the Bad, the So-So (Current Student Review) Pacific Rim College is a post-secondary skills training school that provides educational programs in-Acupuncture ( [L.Ac](https://L.Ac), RTCMP aka a what is considered a masters in TCM in the US, and a Dr of TCM)

\- Phytotherapy ( ask clinical herbalist, which doesn't have a regulatory governing body in BC, and therefore doesn't require licensure to practice the art itself. This program is designed to give you the science of nutrition and application of herbs in a western phytochemical clinical application to western medical diseases)

\- Doula Training

\-Nutrition

You could be considering going to PRC for a variety of reasons such as wanting to get into the field as a clinical nutritionist, herbalist, or licensed acupuncturist. Amongst all the other schools of acupuncture on the west coast, it is the only one that offers dual diplomas in western herbal medicine and acupuncture. Here is a break down of the good which is probably attracting you here in the first place, and an overview of the so-so & the straight-up ugly parts of this school. Be sure to read the whole thing for holistic insight into this school and if it sounds like a fit.

&#x200B;

***The Good:***

Depending on where you live, this school **offers the most western medical science and additional professional and business development courses,** which you can enroll in or audit to supplement your learning if enrolled in the Acupuncture program.

\-It is ""**university-style"" enrollment**, meaning you can enroll in anything they offer and aren't restricted to only taking classes in your program.  Be **mindful to not stray from your course checklist too much**, because anything outside of it won't count towards your graduation! No one clarifies this for you when registering for classes. Stick to your program guide and take additional courses and workshops as they suit you and your extra-curricular budget, and don't delay your grad time!

\- **No minimum GPA requirement, only 2 references,** and paying the application fee. This can be good for those who might have had a bad semester at university or were less inspired in high school and can't get into more prestigious ( and highly expensive schools like Bastyr).

\- **Location**: it is located in beautiful downtown victoria right in market square which is close to many coffee shops, good to-go food places for the health-conscious ( like the bulletproof upgrade labs bar, and green cuisine).

\- **Same-day free acupuncture appointments** for students who are enrolled in a program course. Go and check with the front desk to see if there are any free spots in the clinic today or tomorrow, and you get to get scheduled for free. If you schedule your appointment, students only pay 10 dollars per session.

\- Student Activity Fund: You can submit a petition to get the student body to approve any funds you want to appropriate to coordinate student activities or initiatives.

non-gendered **washrooms-** LGBTQ-friendly campus with non-gendered washrooms, and some awesome, epic, and smart queer teachers.

***The So-So:*** You shouldn't let the good things about this college be the deciding factor, and you should always anticipate that some degree of stress will come with being a student.

*PLEASE keep this section and the Bad section in mind as you weigh your decision to go here or somewhere else vs other programs in BC \[such as pacific royal institute (oshio), Nelson school of Acupuncture, Kwantlen ( only BC public option), or Vancouver school of TCM, see below for a complete list of alternatives\]. These sections are for you, the consumer, to make an informed decision and gauge the level of financial and psychological barriers these two sections highlight which are systemic at this school.*

&#x200B;

**No student community programming offered by admin:**

Looking for a school with school-organized events to meet your peers? Unfortunately, student community events are practically non-existent. If you want to organize something on your own, via your resources and time ( which is a scarce commodity if you're full-time), you have had to lead. if you are introverted but are looking for meeting friends at school the only place to do this is in class. Otherwise, there is no student social programming.

**TRANSFER YOUR PRE-EXISTING CREDITS IN SEMESTER 1 ( they won't count them after sem 1):**

this is an example of their profiteering policies that tend to benefit from your confusion and the lack of clarity they provide at the outset of your journey. For example, I have a university & post-secondary education in which I could have transferred over to apply to the professional development requirements and save money. 

No one will tell you that there is a time-sensitive window in your 1st semester to transfer any credits you might be able to apply.  The second option if you didn't transfer them, is to get dean approval ( and you have to hope your program dean is nice and pleasant to work with), ask for an exemption under previous experience in which you make it up in another credit via electives, or challenge it via writing the final. In the later 3 options, you have to pay them money relatively near the cost it would be to just take the class.

In my assessment: It's a small reflection of their general policies, where they orients themselves to benefit off of the lack of direction they give you. It gets compounded by the poor organization such as doing the onboarding process all through email. There is a lot of fine print in those initial emails.  It would be better if they had a messaging center in their student portal to streamline it, instead of flooding you with a million + emails in the onboarding process and throughout your schooling.

**Acu Program requires ""fluff courses"" that drive up your student debt total** in the Acupuncture program, and I call them fluff because ***they aren't required to write the CTCMA exams***. This goes under the so-so column because depending on where you are starting in your journey this could be your best friend or your biggest headache. It'll be your best friend if you have no post-secondary experience before your enrollment and want some business and writing experience then it could be great for you. (FOR ACU STUDENTS) If you have under 2 years of post-secondary education, this school provides you with increased hours in order to write in Ontario after grad, since you don't have 2 years of post-secondary.)

**How the PRC DTCM program Compares to other schools:**

Since they add up to **33 credits of fluff courses** that stand between you and your end goal ask yourself, do you need professional writing, business development, or other extra research projects to feel confident? Then maybe it's worth the added price tag of an **extra 12,000-14,000 in tuition** it will cost you to complete your program at PRC. Most other schools only require 190 credits and 1100 or so clinic hours which make you eligible to write the DTCM. 

To graduate PRC you don't get a choice to opt out of these 33 credits of extra courses to obtain your diploma, and this can take a whole 2 extra semesters for you to graduate. Something to note.

**The quality of your teachers in your programs is inconsistent:**

Now depending on whether you've ever attended university before, you might not notice it, but there is a tendency to the quality and professional experience the schools teachers have. *People who have minimal teaching experience are* ***privately contracted as independent contractors.*** This means that the teacher they hire is basically running their course and creating their own material to cover the required topics. This ends up, in my experience, resulting in inconsistency in the quality of teachers. Some teachers don't get through all the material because they monologue into their irrelevant rants, some don't have any relevant field-related knowledge in TCM and you're left to bridge the gap. Some teachers, on the other hand, are fantastic and deliver quality presentations and information. Some teachers are very knowledgeable but don't give you any hand-outs or notes and it's pure lecture. One other sad factor is that ***despite some teachers being there for 5+ years, they are still independently contracted despite them technically being employees, and they don't get paid leave, benefits, or bargaining power for pay increases*** when the school raises tuition. It's a sad reflection of a greater problem in society of businesses skirting labor law, PRC is very guilty of this.

**Student mid-semester and end of semester evaluations:**

They provide the illusion that they care about your feedback. But they rarely listen to the meat of the issues and take little to no course in correcting the issues. They kinda just disappear into the void and there is no, ""This is what we heard from you"" breakdown reflection. It makes the so-so because it's nice that they make the gesture of seeming like they care, but if it's any critique of how they do business or missing clinic equipment it goes unacknowledged.

(Subjectively- depending on how privileged you are)

vvvvvvv

***The Ugly Side of PRC ( what you don't see in the green-washed marketing material)***

1. **A lot of Hidden fees and a Shady AF Administration that write shady Academic Policies:**

Need to reschedule a test? That'll be **100.00**

**Missed a clinic and need to make it up? It's 21.00** a clinic you missed even though you already paid for those clinic hours, and you have to do the work to coordinate a make-up clinic. No extenuating circumstances are granted.

Want to take a course at another school? You have to pay them practically the price it would cost to just take it at the school. **It's about 250-400 dollars** for you to take a course somewhere else if you can't get into enough courses at the school, or for whatever reason you need to take a course somewhere else

Need to drop a course after registration closes?

Most public schools give you a week's grace period into the start of the semester. Not here. Once registration is closed and you need to change a course BAM... 10% extra before 1st day of semesters, and up to 30% after that.

&#x200B;

2) **They Hiked tuition by 9% in one semester this year,** and nothing says they won't do it again. This happened despite a huge outcry from the student body pleading for a reduced and sunset implementation of this huge increase in tuition. Keep in mind, publically regulated schools are capped at 2% in one year to account for inflation, and these out of touch profiteer's hiked it by an extra 7% with absolutely no change in quality or improvement to much-needed supplies in the clinics and library resources. Meanwhile, school co-founder Todd Pam is just chillen in a faraway land in Costa Rica getting rich off of you accruing more student debt, and the president is happy to implement out of touch board decisions to enrich themselves despite getting poll results handed to them showing them the negative effects it was having. See the poll results below and comments from PRC students to see what common struggles have arisen. They chose to increase it anyway ""because the PTIB approved it"", aka we'll do what suits our pocketbooks best vs what is in your best interest.

Cost of courses changed as pictured below:

(left) September 2021   VS January 2022 ( right)

675   --------------------------> 735    ( 3 credit course/ or observation clinic)

375 ----------------------------> 412     (1.5 Credit clinic)

1,200 -------------------------> 1,400  ( 6 credit course)

So for full-time student loans requirements, you have to be enrolled in a minimum of 3,675 each semester, and if you play by their timeline and want to graduate within the marketed timeline you have to pay up to 6,100 dollars a semester.  For perspective, that's more expensive than if you went to the University of British Columbia.  My personal opinion is we need a public option for TCM schools.

&#x200B;

3) **An Administration of Gaslighters:**

See a problem at the school? Are you stressed, or struggling from hidden financial penalties? Did the administration not handle something professionally? Are you pointing out inefficiency, or where student life could be improved?

*You'll almost always hear this*

""Well you're the first person who has said anything, and you're the only one who has brought this up, so you must be the only one experiencing it. So it's just your problem.""... "" If you don't like it, go to another school"", OR worse ""you *are* the problem"". Their approach is to shoot the messenger.

It is the kind of response that I have repeatedly heard countless students share similar stories, and it makes the students to feel psychologically manipulated and unsupported when having to deal with the school's administration. It's a sit-down, shut up, don't say anything, know your place kinda vibe. It's very reminiscent of Jeff bezos vs Unionization efforts kinda vibes.

They don't give a shit about their student's well-being, and I really mean that. They care about scaling their business profits and giving you very very little grace or flexibility in return. The proof is in the pudding of student polling ( included below), where they ignored the information even after a small student collective organized to sit with the admin to represent the student's voices. Neo-liberal capitalism runs deep in this institution, in that their reply was ""then go to another school if you don't like it"".

4) **No Bus pass program, no student with disabilities services, no health benefits**; Do you want health coverage as a student? They don't provide it, and also no bus pass program so you better live close or drive if you want to be able to get to school efficiently. Victoria busses are pretty good, but this is a huge area where they could do the bare minimum to improve student life. Students with a disability and need accommodation? HA, this school will say it's your problem. See below point

**False advertising of Time to Graduate for DTCM & ACU:**

Can you afford 5,000+ of tuition each semester plus your living costs? Or better put, do you think you can manage 10+ courses and not burn out? Yeah, most people can't so this is why I'm highlighting this huge glaring reality check if you're looking at the Acu program here. If you can maintain a 20-25 credit course load ( yeah you read that right they require you to take a whopping 25 credits to count as a 100% course load) maybe you have a hope of getting out of there in the 6 semesters ( or the marketed 10 semesters for DTCM).

If you are just a humble student getting fiscal support from student aid bc, with the recent tuition increase at this school, it is really hard to afford rent, food, transportation, AND maintain a 25 credit course load to graduate and get on with your life ( We're talking 4,500-5,500 a semester).

I recommend researching another local school, Oshio as an option b for the more fiscally savvy folks looking to graduate with less debt and quicker. Oshio has a 115 credit graduate requirement and PRC is 133 credits to graduate ( roughly 18 credits/1 semester/ 4,500 difference)

5)I **If you are a student who struggles with a permanent physical or mental disability** ( such as ADD, ADHD, PTSD, Dyslexia) Get a walk-in or family doctor to fill out the [appendix 8 form on student aid BC](https://studentaidbc.ca/sites/all/files/form-library/appendix_8.pdf) and you will qualify for 5,000 extra in funding, reduced course load requirement down to 40% to qualify for full-time, and be able to ask for extra time and accommodations for your tests. You also can submit receipts for tutors or help-aids and student-aid will reimburse you for your cost.

6) **Clinic & Course inconsistency:**

You better hope they have enough teachers to offer the courses you need to maintain your graduation schedule. They have a course-by-semester sheet that is basically worthless because they never stick to it completely. If it says they'll offer it, don't count on it. Thats, why this is making the ugly list, because you're graduation time, is completely dependent on if the teacher is available and if there is student demand. They MIGHT run it if it is the only course you need and it's your last semester, despite being the only person needing it, but most likely they'll say you'll just have to wait. ***Clinics are a mad dash to get into*** if you aren't into the 90 + credit 1st or 2nd wave of registration. And the credits in the semester leading up to meeting the 90 credit threshold, don't count until your grade are calculated. These scenarios can set you back a semester if there aren't enough clinics.You won't be in first wave until your 4th or 6th semester. They often don't have enough teachers to offer the amount of clinics students really need.  It gets dog-eat-dog for courses and clinics midway in your program. Making it all the more likely you'll be delayed.

**Primarily WHITE , RICH, and ABLE-BODIED campus:** Now there are some lovely humans who grace the halls and the students are cool. However, there is little to no diversity at this school, for example there is terrible wheelchair accessibility at this school. You'll see women of color who work at the front, but only UP FRONT. The entire board and administration are white AF and very ***uninvolved in the school*** with little to no involvement in the student body. But they were all comfortable raising tuition  3x the provinically public regulated inflation adjustment without consult, only announcement during a summer break period.

Depending on who you are, and your relative status of economic & social privilege, you might not care, and feel quite comfortable here. There are after all friendly students who attend this school.. However if you're in the BIPOC you won't see yourself represented too much. For example you'll note that they don't even celebrate Chinese New Year at a TCM school, not even a sign.

**I hope you get a nice program dean:**

Each department has a different dean for the program. Some of them I've heard are quite collaborative and kind.  From experience, the dean of the acupuncture program currently is a little power-over-you for power over you sake. What do I mean by this? The dean tends to give you very unhelpful, kurt responses, and frankly is quite unprofessional at times. There tend to be mediocre answers given that leave you feeling unsupported, or shut down if you're advocating for a need like class availability needs, if your trying to negotiate missed clinics, or credit transfers after the first semester. Now in fairness, on occasion (unless there is a chance to slap an extra administrative fee in there), she can be helpful for students with things like course requirements, credit inquiries, externship inquiries, etc. But for the most part, most students get a cold shoulder / stand-offish/ ""look down my nose at you"" vibe from her. Other deans I have heard are very friendly, helpful, and are collaborative with students in the phytotherapy and nutritionist programs.

&#x200B;

I grew up in government housing next to a child between the age of my younger brother and myself.  We became friends and his grandmother who raised him became part of the family.   I'll call him Jeremy.

His story is one of tragedy again and again beginning with the death of his mother shortly after his birth.  Father unknown.

Growing up with him was interesting and eventful.  He often got into scuffs with other kids our age in which I would mediate and de escalate.  Soon as  I was old enough to understand I understood that he had some mental health struggles and was on medications for them. 

His grandmother was an older woman on disability just trying to make the best life for her grandson she could often taking Jeremy with my brother and myself out on hikes and adventures on the island with their dog.  Both our parents were unable to do these things with us so without his grandmother we would have not seen sooke potholes or wittys lagoon ever let alone as often as we got to in our childhood.  She did the best she could to keep Jeremy out of trouble until she died in her sleep out of the blue for unknown reasons.  

With Jeremys debilitating mental health conditions after the death of his grandmother it was not long before he became homeless and used drugs to cope with the loss of his only anchor to safety in this society.  Jeremy has no family other then a convict uncle who takes advantage of him for the purpose of committing crimes for cash.  The whole time I lived beside Jeremy and his grandmother I had only heard of him as he was in jail for our entire childhood. From his birth Jeremy never stood a chance alone in this world and has always and will always need some sort of social assistance to live a life with any sort of stability.   

Yesterday I ran into Jeremy for the first time in 7 years on the street and he looked awful, it truly broke my heart.  I smiled and waved to get his attention and offered him all my leftover turkey dinner to which he replied ""yes please"" He said he just returned to Victoria from living with his ""crazy uncle"" and now lives in a tent somewhere on cook st.   With the weather how it was last night I couldn't sleep knowing Jeremy was out there in the wet freezing cold living in a tent when he deserves at least a room to keep himself safe from the elements, treatment for his addictions and medication for his debilitating mental health conditions.

Jeremy is still fairly young and I believe he still has a chance at cleaning himself up so that one day he may be able to see the children that were taken from him (needed to be done given the obvious)  

I'm sorry if this post is hard to read/follow I just saw him walking around the public health clinic off cook st on the way home and want so badly to help him get all the help he can but don't know how or where to start.  Just that I can be an advocate for his life history and help with any paperwork etc Jeremy needs to do that he might not understand etc.

VictoriaBC,Isla_de_paz,"Does it make sense to live in Victoria when it comes to rent and living expenses? Hi there, I was just looking for some advice or words of experience to help make an informed decision. 

I recently interviewed for a position with a post secondary University here in Victoria and I was offered the job!  I am from Calgary and have struggled to break out of retail so this could potentially be a life changing opportunity.  I'm very undecided as to what I should do.  Aside from the job itself, a larger concern that is heavy on my mind is the subject of housing and rent.  

The place I share with my girlfriend in Calgary is a decent 2 bedroom and we pay around $1250 per month (split between us its about $620 in terms of what we individually pay and contribute towards rent).  Looking throughout postings and checking out property management companies like Devon, it is becoming a reality to me that, to have something of a similar nature out here in Victoria, it would be $2000+ per month, maybe even $3000+..  

The opportunity I have pays quite well, my salary would be around $3800 per month, but when rent is factored into everything, more than half my income would be going towards housing.  How far would a remaining income of $1700+/- go in Victoria when living expenses, utility costs, transportation costs (gas, insurance, car maintenance) are all considered?  I think it most definitely can be done, but I worry would it be a reality where one is living pay check to pay check and simply surviving (no accumulation of savings or ability to invest)  or is there an opportunity to thrive in Victoria?

Of course my girlfriend would work as well, and even if she was working part time on a minimal wage, ($15.65 x at least 24 hours/per week=a monthly income of around $1500) It would further add to our overall income and give us greater flexibility in terms of how we live and the quality of life we would have.  My family have also offered to help us throughout our transition, to cover rent at first for a month or two, and to help out with any other expenses, but I don't think such would be a sustainable option going forward or looking more long term.  If we need the support of family just to get by it doesn't seem like a feasible option or life.

Is this doable? Would a conservative estimate of a shared monthly income of $5300 (3800+1500) be enough to live in a comfortable housing situation?  Would the income that remains after, be enough to provide for living expenses like food, gas/transportation costs, bills, and savings?

As said, I am desperate to leave retail and this opportunity is appealing but the sticker shock of a life here in Victoria is a bit overwhelming and a cause for concern.","Lived Experience, Our Place, Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, People with lived experience, Sooke Transition House Society, Victoria Women in Need, Victoria Women's Transition House",1,True,0.0

[Streetorigin.com](https://Streetorigin.com) is a digital catalogue of streets in Victoria. Due to time and cost restrictions only streets in Esquimalt, Victoria CBD and Oak Bay have been added from their respective archives. Zoom in and click on streets to find out why they got their name. Some names are boring. Some are quite interesting. Feel free to check out the ""about"" and ""analytics"" tabs at the top of the page.

As I am not a developer and have no idea how to code, this site has so much more to become functionally useful including:

A search bar

A way to add content

Monetization program

Mobile version

Archive networking

Archive supported validation

National scalability

Backend infrastructure

&#x200B;

I am considering filing for a research grant to support the development costs for this idea, however as I am between jobs I don't exactly have time to fill out the paperwork for a submission.

Hope your day has been chill. 
I recently started a job in Sidney and I live downtown (Harris Greene area). The car commute has been murder to my mental health. I loathe the Pat bay highway, even more now that they have started the overpass. 
I am going to start cycling to work which is in the industrial area of sidney.

How long does it take you to commute via bike to sidney? (Google maps says 1h40m @10kmh, I know that can't be the real time)

As an alumni, I really want to help. I'm going back to school myself and need the extra money for my own tuition. I live in a nice 3 bed townhouse with a whole basement floor that could be easily turned into a large bedroom/den/office and I know it could work.  Here's where I need advice:

\- I've heard so many horror stories of renters (either full unit rented out or a room in a house) getting some sort of squatting rights and owners not be able to remove them.How can I protect myself from inviting someone into my home (for rent) and ***absolutely*** make sure I can get rid of them if there's any hint of trouble (drugs, dangerous behaviour, etc?)

\- I live w my 11yr old daughter (shared 50/50 with her dad), so I have concerns about inviting someone to live with us (shared kitchen/bathrooms) esp. if they are a first-year party-friendly student...

**Is it fair** (?) to offer a room/office if I need to ask them to be quiet, no friends or partners to visit, no cars, no smoking, no pets, etc? If it was me, I wouldn't want to live like that, but I feel need to ask for these things since they would be living with me and my daughter.  Is the rental market so tough that a new or returning UVic student would even want to live with those conditions?

\- What is a fair/typical rental price to ask? This will impact bills (which I will include in rent), my house insurance and my quiet life dramatically. The space is huge (like a full living room, carpet, would be furnished, has a window... but it is a basement, and they would be living with an 11yr old part-time...

When I mentioned that I would've liked to live somewhere without freezing temps and perhaps less French, a friend of mine suggested Victoria (I had thought of Vancouver but everyone told me it was both ""expensive"" and ""very hard to live"").

Victoria looks beyond beautiful from what I've seen. The fact that I'll be able to go out comfortably from December to March is actually amazing lol. And I like that it feels like a small town (almost 200 times less people than where I'm from haha)

However I know this is a big decision to make. And I know that it's an expensive city to live in-- at least, I imagine, more expensive than Montréal, where I currently live downtown in my parents' house.

So I wanted to ask your opinions: would a law grad be able to get by comfortably with a roommate (my partner will be moving with me)? Would there be any prospects for renting (maybe even one day buying) a house somewhere nice (not necessarily luxurious but safe & central, preferably close to downtown)? Would I be able to get by without a car (I only ever relied on the transit system in Montréal)?

VictoriaBC,JamDupes,"Baseball card collecting in Victoria is damn hard. Let’s get together and make it easier. Looking to start a meetup with fellow baseball enthusiasts. Like the title suggests, I have found my hobby of collecting baseball cards pretty darn difficult in Victoria. Mostly because of how hard it is to find fellow card collectors. That and just plain access to new cards as they come out. 

As far as I can tell there is only [one brick and mortar store](http://tripleplaysc.com) that even retails baseball cards. Their selection is very limited, probably because the market is so small. There is also a [semi regular meetup](https://www.vicollectibles.com) where collectors can get together and share/trade/buy/sell. Lastly there is r/baseballcards here on reddit, which is a great way to connect and find cards, though the vast majority of its subscribers are in the states/international. 

So, I figured why not use this platform to see who’s out there in Victoria that shares my hobby. What I’m hoping is to find a few people who would be interested in growing the hobby here in the city. Whether it be attending the meetup together, or perhaps asking the retail outlets (there are other stores beyond the one I listed, though they don’t presently carry cards) to take a greater interest in distributing here in Vic, or just plain pooling out resources together and look to order our own supplies of cards. I do plenty of case breaks (YouTube it if you don’t know what that means) and I’d love to do some live here with like minded enthusiasts. 

That’s it. Feel free to comment and perhaps we can get something going, even if it’s just a few of us it can make the hobby so much more fun.

Edit: Since this post had a few really good responses I wanted to add that a) I am more than happy to organize a box break or meet up or anything of the like for March, should people be interested.

My boyfriend and I just moved to Victoria. We are renting the basement suite of a house. We are expecting a lot of mail to facilitate our move-- my boyfriend moved from the States and needs his driving record, for example-- and our landlords only have one mailbox (theirs). They have promised us to check the mail every day and deliver it to us. When we have checked the mailbox, they have asked us to stop, possibly because it makes their dogs bark. However, that means that 1) we often are left wondering if we received a piece of mail or if they just have forgotten to deliver it that day, 2) we have to wait until they get home to give us the mail, 3) we receive our mail a day or two late because they forget to check it, 4) our mail sometimes gets wet because they place it outside our door. 

Since they will not allow us to check their mailbox, we have asked for a mailbox and they have told us that there is nowhere to put it, which is not quite true.

Are we being unreasonable? Are there laws that are in our favour? We also want to have some privacy from our landlords and just don't like the idea that we are not allowed to check our own mailbox.

Back in May I moved into a new Victoria sublet apartment, which happened to have a unique toilet with a fancy/weird macerator that flushes upwards.

I don’t even need all 10 of my fingers to count the number of times I have ridden a bus that arrived on time. Today was the last straw for me.

Edit: I want to highlight that this is more about the selling practice & service of Orca Spirit Adventure instead of seeing whales. The customer service was quick to take our money without explaining their refund policy and made us sign a waiver without actually reading it saying it’s just “standard”. Looking back, I realize what a big RED FLAG this was. Also when we asked them to put us on a boat for the next day to try again, they weren’t willing to do that. So they aren’t even willing to accommodate you since they already took your money and now they are on to the next person to rip off.

Also why aren’t they being much more accurate and saying this is going to an overpriced boat ride where you may or may not get to see whales. Calling it a whale tour is entirely false. Their sales team says they have a 96% success rate which I don’t believe at all, so why lie? This entire process left a dent in our entire trip to Victoria. 

Original post: Hi, we took a whale tour with Orca Spirit Adventures Whale watching. It was supposed to be 3 hours long but they started 30 minutes late and ended 15 minutes early. We also didn't get to see any whales or animals! The crew just made jokes and couldn't be bothered. 

On top of all this, they didn't want to issue a refund. Instead they stated if you didn't see any whales you can come back anytime in your life and come and see it. 

It just felt like a tourist trap. First off, a lot of these people will only visit Victoria once in their life, what kind of option is this. Secondly, a lot of other companies provide refunds but they don't.

I frequently encounter intersections where there are two lanes; one that is right turn only, and one that is left turn and straight through combined. 
Today, I pulled up behind the one car that was waiting to go straight. I pulled up behind and slightly to the inside of the lane and waiting for the green, signalling my left hand turn intentions. 


 The opposing traffic was clear and the car ahead of me had gone straight.  There was a car quite close that had pulled up behind me and he was going straight.

Our hearts are often in the right place, but there are many reasons for this and if you ask an expert (I am not one), they will agree;

\- it can expose the animal to disease and spread it further

\- many animals can't process/digest the food we give them

\- it can cause the animal to see humans as a source of food which can be dangerous to us and them

\- it alters their natural behavior - for example, it can cause the bird to not migrate which can lead to starvation.

VictoriaBC,JesseB1234,"Being the best driver in Victoria is exhausting It is impossible to drive anywhere in town without seeing blatant road law, rule and safety violations.  ICBC needs (to be disbanded, and insurance be public first of all) to implement a refresher course at certain intervals for a VERY complacent driver base.

This isn’t just a rant, and definitely not hate, but I want to outline some daily occurrences I deal with and why they’re awful, and what you can do about it.  I’ve been driving safely, defensively and confidently for 15 years accident free.  I know everyone else is the best driver in Victoria to themselves as well.  I’m also sure these aren’t just Victoria problems, I’ve just matured as a driver here for the past 8 years and have really become cognizant of it recently.

Anger doesn’t belong on the road.  Years ago I realized this and switched from flipping people off, to a very disappointed thumbs down.  I think it hits harder, differently and better.  Instead of feeling attacked and getting angry, I hope people sense the disappointment in their selfish and ignorant driving and think about it, hopefully leading to change.

Solid white lines are there for a reason, generally in high activity spots where a lane change is unsafe.  Crossing a solid white line with all 4 tires of your vehicle is a road violation (chapter 3, p.39 ‘Learn to drive’).  I’m looking at you Mckenzie overpass.

Being courteous is one thing, and of course a nice thing to do.  Stopping in an active roadway to let someone turn in front of you (or let a jaywalker through) is unpredictable, and dangerous.  Especially reckless if the person turning is crossing two vehicle lanes and a bike lane, which they cannot see, and in my personal experience I have seen avoidable accidents had the rules of the road been followed.

Speaking of cyclists, they exist.  I dislike them as a whole, but they’re there.  When I am a cyclist, I detest drivers, it’s just how it works.  I’ve been behind a cyclist, on my own bike riding nicely in our lane, had a car leisurely pass us, and then turn right directly in front of the cyclist in front of me, who went head over heels over the trunk of this ignorant vehicle.  Shoulder checks are a necessity for every right hand turn and lane change. And if you’re making a right turn and you have to stop and yield, don’t stop entirely in the bike lane as I see at pretty much every yield.

Commit to your mistakes.  If you realize you’re in a turn only lane but you *wanted* to go straight, or miss your exit on the highway, don’t make it everyone else’s problem and cause an issue.  Commit to your error and take another route.

Rolling stops are illegal, but we all do it, it saves gas and wear and tear on vital vehicle parts - it’s just economical.  The ones that bother me are people ripping up to an intersection, blowing past the stop line, through the crosswalk and stopping exactly at the road they’re entering.  This is unpredictable and looks like you’re just going to help yourself to the lane.  I see a lot of people doing ignorant moves on the road because it just seems like they *wanted to* and it would be inconvenient for them to follow the rules.

Squeezing in that last left hand turn as the light turns red, and then promptly sitting in the intersection and blocking traffic going the other way.  You’re not that important, wait a light cycle.

Large trucks need space to stop, that distance they’re leaving in front of them isn’t for you to squeeze in right in front of them and then slow down.  I’ve seen several trucks lock their brakes completely up when someone decides they’re invincible and more important to dart in front of them, then slow down for the red light coming up.

Large trucks again, this “I’m bigger, I’ll win, I’m just going” attitude sucks.  I have very little regard for my well being, and ZERO regard for my vehicle.  If you squish me, that’ll be on your conscience.  And all because you didn’t feel like stopping and starting again, or that light was inconvenient.

Merging - DEAR LAWD MERGING.  I cannot believe the amount of Victorians who still blow merging, we’ve even got signs on merging lanes with printed instructions, pictures and everything.  Get up to highway speed, pick your spot, turn signal on, end of the merge lane move confidently over into your spot.  It is not the responsibility of the highway lane to brake, move or otherwise make a spot for you, the highway is minding its own business trying to stay at speed.

Parking.  This goes back to ICBC’s refresher, or you as road users should take the initiative to practice.  Head to a suburb, practice some parallel parking, it’s a skill, we live in a city with rapidly dwindling downtown parking.  If you see a spot, signal, stop before it so traffic leaves you room, pull up and park.

SCHOOL ZONES, like cyclists - they exist!  Everyone behind me seems to be completely flabbergasted when I go from 50km/h down to 30km/h abruptly as a school zone begins.  Then totally left in the dust when it ends?  It doesn’t seem like anyone remembers that the backside of a school zone sign in the other lane indicates that the zone ends and to resume regular speeds.  Signs are becoming tough to read as the world around us is turning to ‘wallpaper’ as my coworker put it, signs everywhere, way too many to read or absorb.  The ones you need to read? The road signs on the road you’re using, telling you how to use that road.  It definitely seems people forget they’re piloting a multi-ton death machine.

It’s not that I’m in a rush, I just want to get where I’m going.  Going to Oak Bay is a death sentence for my sanity.  I’m all for a casual driving experience, but please let’s follow the rules of the road and drive predictably.  Speed limits are just that, limits, it’s fine to go slower - within reason.  I’ll be pulling my hair out if you’re going 30 in a 50max zone though, all according to road conditions of course.

Hopefully this reaches some of the audience it applies to.  If you actually made it through all that, thank you, and I’m interested to see what you’ve got to contribute, and also feedback.  If I’m wrong I’ll gladly learn from it.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: I lied, I just realized I *have* been in a not at fault collision - I'm sorry.  I was stopped in a line of traffic, had been for a minute, nowhere to go, waiting to proceed and a distracted driver behind me who had ""spilled their coffee"" (not a drop in sight during insurance exchange...) went full speed into the back of my work truck.  No big deal on my end.   


I will also wholly admit I am not educated enough on the ICBC situation to continue on either side of dissolution or reform.  I am on the side that costs us the least, and protects us the most.  I am not a current fan of what are to me, exorbitant rates for what is offered.  Having paid premiums the equivalent in my lifetime of a down payment on a house I'll never own *here,* in insurance I've never used, for a vehicle to get me to work, to afford to live, and *maybe* that house is disheartening.

COVID has us all burned out in some way or another (I'm generalizing again, just like the rolling stops), I'm not trying start something, just don't want to see these things on the road every day.  I'm using the only platform I subscribe to as my soapbox for it.  I took 30 mins out of my day to get it off my chest (yes, thank you for those who asked if it felt better, it does).

So I'll start just by explaining the situation. TL/DR at the bottom.

A while ago, we had a small get together in Oak Bay. Cops arrived and handled the situation incorrectly.

The municipal bylaw is pretty sound in stating that they can implement an infraction for any level of noise at any time.

(http://oakbay.ca/sites/default/files/municipal-services/bylaws/3210.pdf)

At about 1:30 am, I had 3 members of Oak Bay PD arrive at my house. When I had noticed the Police were at the door, I had turned the music down to a level below that of which would be considered watching a movie. Before speaking with me when I had answered the door, an officer booked it into my back yard (without a warrant). 

Once I opened the door and spoke to the officer, I had noticed the first officer go into the backyard and asked if they would please talk to me before searching the property without a warrant. (Within my rights)

The officers then informed me that ""The party was over"". The small get together (no more than 15-20 people) had already mostly dispersed. I had informed them that the majority of people on the property were either leaving or had already left, and that I had already turned the music down to the point of watching a movie and was open to a compromise on the level of sound.

They informed me again that the party was over. I had explained to them that yes it was, it was late, but the people who were there (5 that live there, and maybe 4 additional) were staying the night, and we would come to an agreeable level for the volume.

Nope, the party was still over and people had to leave. (The people that were staying were staying because they were intoxicated and could not legally drive home)

I complied and was willing to come to an even ground on the situation the whole time. However, they took me asking for them to stay within my rights as defiance. They asked for my I.D.

They ran my name, and to no surprise, they had nothing. At this point, one of my room mates came out and talked to them. He told them we would abide by anything they had to say, and for them to be on their way.

They still had my I.D. when they left.

The officer involved came back the next day with my I.D. and a Bylaw infraction. I disputed the ticket due to the negligence of protocol when it came to searching my property, issuing a warning, and exploitation of my rights.

The ticket that they had written was on a Traffic Infraction. So, it got thrown out, which I had no idea about. During this time, I was calling and trying to figure out what was going on with my dispute. Neither the municipal hall or the Oak Bay PD had any dispute on file. I was given a run around between the two organizations.

They put me through to the officer which originally issued me the ticket, to which she claimed that she couldn't do anything and the municipal hall had my dispute. After telling her I had talked to the municipal hall less than 5 minutes ago, she proceeded to tell me it was still in their hands and there was nothing she could do. I then asked why she picked up the call if she could not do anything to resolve this issue. It's within my rights to know what is happening with my dispute. I then asked for her supervisor to call me.

Her supervisor called me and explained that they had written the infraction on a traffic bylaw ticket, and it would be up to the issuing officer to re-issue the ticket. I asked that if I were to be re-issued a ticket, that it not be the original officer as it seems that there is conflict every time we speak. He explained that he could not promise due to man power. If she was the only person available, it would have to be that way.

So instead of coming himself to issue the ticket, he brought her as an impartial mediator. (against what I had asked, even though they obviously had the man power. The supervisor could have come on his own.)

So I now have a court date set and will be disputing this ticket. Any one have some insight on the court systems and municipal bylaws?

Hopefully things will go smooth....

TL/DR - I was issued a noise complaint (Bylaw infraction), It was handled completely incorrectly. They stole my ID for over 24 hours, had to issue the ticket on 2 separate tickets, and stepped over their boundaries and searched my back yard without warrant. I was given the run around between the municipal hall and Oak bay PD. I've never gone to court before..... Any help?

EDIT - Curious on presentation on court date, how to speak to a judge, anything! Am I within my rights at the moment? Anything I can do to help resolve this issue a little easier???",Point in Time,0,False,0.0

VictoriaBC,Jhuderis,"PSA - Shaw/Rogers Now Has Multi-Layered Retention Story time:

For context, I was with Shaw for 30 years...until this week. Over the years, various other companies would run promos or pricing in general would decrease for services or service speed for internet would increase on average for the price. I'd call Shaw and talk to a retention specialist and they'd almost always be able to offer me something that brought me in line with competitors (or very close) and it was fairly easy to stay. 

This time when I called, the billing person said ""I am now retention. Billing and retention are the same."" 

Ok. I explain how I can get 3x the internet speed for 30% cheaper at a competitor with no contract and it's not an introductory price. I asked them to match. Shaw offered me the same speed for $5 MORE than what I'm already paying AND I had to sign a 2-year contract for the privilege. So we did some math together and I showed how I'd pay $800 less over the 24 months with their competitor... one that buys their service wholesale from Shaw which is pretty funny. 

They said ""Sorry that's my best offer."" I said that was a shame and that I'd have to cancel after 30 years. They said ""ok there's nothing more I can do. Thanks."" 

I set up new service with the competitor and then got on a chat with Shaw to do the final cancellation. Right after I cancel via the chat, who do I get a call from? The REAL retention specialist trying to give me a screaming deal (like 1/2 price) to stay with Shaw. 

At that point I told them to get bent and that they had their chance. I was not going to cancel my new service, send back hardware, wait for their techs etc. all for the privilege of feeling like they lied to me. 

Anywhoo. If you are considering leaving Shaw because of the Rogers takeover or any other reason, actually go through with the cancellation before you get a real retention person to make you a legit offer. 

If I hadn't already ordered another service I could have just said yes to their offer and stayed without any interruptions to my service. ",Point in Time,0,False,0.0

VictoriaBC,Jujub555,"Law bans Electric skateboards and scooters everywhere in BC Currently, users of electric skateboards are being fined more than $500 by police for riding in BC. The fine is for driving a motor vehicle without insurance, but according to ICBC, scooters skateboards and some bikes, relying on electric motors are not up to motor vehicle safety regulations stated in the Motor Vehicle Act. Some electric bikes, categorized as pedal assist bikes avoid this regulation simply because they still have the option of pedaling, alongside the electric motor.

[Some popular producers of electric skateboards are: Boosted, Mellow, Meepo, Inboard, Slick Revolution](https://preview.redd.it/0re84zeg3qa11.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c463738f3295f89c5d3d3c7141caad24e81fa22)

Single rider electric vehicles are becoming much more popular for a number of reasons,

1. They are cheap and efficient, electric vehicles tend to range from $300 - $2000+, they are quick, versatile and can have ranges over 25 Km, making them a very good choice of transport for single riders.
2. They are small, in the case of electric skateboards they are very light and small compared to bikes, which are the go to alternative. But many people, with rising housing prices have small houses where even storing a bike can be a challenge. They are also small enough to be brought onto work sites, to be stored ( and or recharged ) in a place of convenience for the day.
3. Eco smart, need I explain? *Electric* bikes, boards and scooters produce 0 carbon.

When used responsibly, electric skateboards and scooters should be seen as no more dangerous then their unpowered predecessors. Like cars, shouldn't the operator be allowed to freely operate their vehicle and be protected by the law, not as risk of massive fines as long as they are driving responsibly, safely and politely. If the issue truly is that they cannot be insured, then why don't they hurry up and find a way for us responsible drivers to insure them so we can drive legally. As for the issue of these modes of transport being reliant on their motors, *they aren't.* Like a pedal assist bike, riding an electric skateboard does not stop you from skating manually, therefore with the board off, why can't they be ridden in public like a traditional board? If electric assist bikes, and unpowered scooters and boards are given the rights and responsibilities to be ridden as traditional bikes downtown why can't electric boards also get this right? They are no faster, less visible or dangerous.

If these electric vehicles are legal on roadways in NYC, and be causing no problems, why are the citizens of British Columbia being punished for choosing the cheaper, easier, cleaner method of personal, inner city transport.

Please, share the road.

VictoriaBC,K-townsFinest,"EV Charging Troubles on the West Shore and why my car got melted. Yesterday morning I drove my EV in to the West Shore for work from my home in East Sooke. On arrival I struggled to find a functioning public EV charger. This is a normal part of my day to day operating a green business on the West Shore since I bought my EV around 3 years ago. 

There actually used to be way more chargers, but over the last 3 years I've watched as charging stations broke down and never got fixed or repaired, despite my many warnings and reports.

A great example would be Metchosin, where the City Hall there deliberately turned their charger off years ago and slapped an out-of-order sign on it because they likely didn't want to pay for it anymore. I only know this since I was charging there one day and the lady came outside and said it wasn't supposed to be working. The other station in Metchosin continued working for around a year, but has now been down for another year since it broke. 

Another example is the Juan de Fuca library, where the two functional stations there slowly broke down and never got fixed. Calling the number for City Hall in Colwood which is on the station didn't make any difference though, as they said the stations were not fixed due to a dispute over who would pay for the repairs. A dispute which has carried on now for several years.

BC Hydro hasn't helped the situation any, since they don't have any stations except the two fast charging stations at the Juan de Fuca park and ride. They built their first station there a few years ago, and also aquired the other station from Greenlots there, so now there's two. They decided to make the stations free for the last two years, which ensured that there was almost no chance of ever charging there unless you waited so long it made the fact that they are fast charging moot. 

Recently during the peak of the Third Wave, BC Hydro and the Utilities commission decided to up and change the charging rates to three times as expensive as they were before they were made free. They were .35 cents per kilowatt hour, but are now changed to .21 cents per MINUTE lol. This new rate is really unethical because the machines themselves slow down on purpose at 80% without the consumer being informed of it, and also because charging is so much slower in the winter, without using any more power. The reason for the new outrageous prices? To reduce demand so they don't have to build new infrastructure, of course.

So the end result of all this is that I decided to test a charger in Colwood which I had reported several times over the last two months for not working properly. My car had been shutting the charger off, likely due to power surges, and so I warned Colwood city hall about the problem. They said BC Hydro owned the charger, who then said it was a Flo charger. So I called them and let them know about the issue. 

About two weeks ago I noticed someone plugging in there and the station made a loud buzzing sound when they did. They unplugged, and I called Flo to let them know that the situation was devolving and putting vehicles and their batteries at risk. They made a note of it, and I figured for sure that they would have immediately come to fix the problem, and barring that, put the station out of service. 

None of that actually happened, and being desperate one morning I figured I would test it to see if it would work. I saw someone had been charging there earlier so I figured it was functional. No way that such a problem would be ignored, right? So I plugged in and heard no buzzing. I watched for about 5 minutes for my car to shut it down as usual if it was still broken. But this never happened. Instead, the charging nozzle just got red hot and started melting into my car lol. 

Luckily the damage is mostly cosmetic, but this situation could have been MUCH worse. One other EV driver comes to mind who often leaves his dog in his car for an hour or more while he sits at Tim Hortons across the street. Imagine if his car had started on fire and nobody was around to help the dog inside? Could have been a major issue but thankfully it seems only my car was melted by the broken station.

Most public chargers are taken over by retired people who have nothing else to do during the day, so none of the green businesses which were started in the last 10 years can charge there when they need to. We are all pretty much sharing about 5 total public chargers on the entire West Shore and of course none of them are in the shade which they are supposed to be for EV health. 

In the end, Flo told me that they had sent a technician multiple times to the station and reached out to Colwood City Hall who is the technical owner of the unit, and mentioned that it may have boiled down to a funding issue. Colwood City Hall however has said that they weren't aware of any message from Flo about it over the last two months. Of course I find that hard to believe considering I know about the Library chargers not being fixed for years due to a dispute over who should pay for it. 

Another frustrating element to this West Shore EV Charging Crisis is that two new stations just got built overnight in Langford near the fountain on Goldstream. Really nice spot for EV charging stations, I thought, until the next day signs were erected proclaiming that those parking spots were now owned outright by a company called Modo, who's slogan is ""we share cars!"" but clearly their generousity doesn't extend to sharing their chargers or their fancy, now privately owned and coveted *public* parking spots. 

So why is this all SO STUPID???

Look, I don't know who is supposed to be responsible for building proper infrastructure for EV users to help them get around. Maybe it's the Federal or Provincial governments, and shouldn't be the sole responsibility of municiple governments. But whoever is supposed to be in charge is simply not doing the math properly. 

I don't personally care whether or not the stations are free. To me, it seems like the solution for this is to build a ton of stations and just charge for their use so that there's money to fix them instead of literally risking lives by leaving them broken. I had a nice mouthfull of gross black plastic smoke when I unplugged the car yesterday as it was melting. So technically, starting a green business on the West Shore has left a poor taste in my mouth. 

My suggestion is for the City of Langford to take the bull by the horns and build a square area of 50 EV chargers in the back parking lot of the Superstore at the Langford Plaza. In the middle of the spots, build a large, living wall to provide shade for at least a portion of those stations at any given time. These stations don't break without being used, and as long as they're being used then they will be generating some money to put towards maintenance. 

Whoever owns them wont see any profit likely until some years have gone by, which is why they should be building them now really. It doesn't make sense that there's a boom of EV sales, BC Hydro knows what demand is already really like when electricity is free, but no stations are being built. The system is clearly stressed as it is. 

I just don't see us hitting the 2040 target of everyone having an EV at this rate. I'm also not really able to compete with other gas powered companies given the lack of infrastructure, and I've heard that from other EV based businesses like food delivery drivers who have to sit at stations really far from any restaurants, while gas vehicle drivers can sit outside the restaurants and hog all the orders. I also used to see some Geo Courier companies all the time, but never see them anymore. Go figure, these business types are meant to drive really far from their homes, like mine, so I can see why they aren't doing too well.


TLDR: There are not enough EV chargers on the West Shore and my car got melted because the stations are free, leaving no money to pay for repairs.

Solution: Build more stations (whoever) and charge fair prices for them (giving retired people a discount) so that there is money for repairs. Rates should be per kWh, NOT per minute which is unfair due to slower charging in the winter. Prices should be set to ensure EV's are able to outcompete gas vehicles, including older model EVs with worn batteries.","Reaching Home , Service provider ",0,False,0.0

As someone whose lived in this city my whole life I'd be lying if I didn't say I was curious. After doing a bit of searching online myself, I thought I'd ask to see what people knew about them. I'm aware that there are tunnel like places downtown underneath places like broad street with the purple-ish prisms on the sidewalk but those don't seem like the tunnels people have been referring to. Those are more for storage in the buildings next to them. I was just hoping for some basic info like locations and what the tunnels are like and if they actually do exist. I've been told they're popular with with the homeless downtown so there are a lot of needles and trash down them. I know there have been posts like this in the past but it wouldn't be Reddit without a bit of reposting right?  Not that I condone such acts, this isn't 9gag after all.

>On Wednesday, I climbed a traffic light pole in front of the Ministry of Health to demonstrate and advocate for the need for Safe Supply to prevent toxic drug deaths. My son Aubrey died earlier this month from exposure to toxic, blackmarket drugs. My acrobatic feat gained the attention of thirty strapping, compassionate, and supportive first responders...but zero politicians. My efforts were educational to me, but largely ineffective. ALL of the first responders told me they supported my efforts, but it is a shame that I engaged the first line responders who are on the front lines dealing with the toxic drug crisis and not the politicians who can do something about it. Plan B: What I want to do now is to create a daily, ongoing presence at the Ministry of Health--one that does not break the law or inconvenience the public (or endanger me) but nonetheless generates media attention and puts pressure on the politicians.My plan is to run a marathon a day around the Ministry of Health Building on Pandora and Blanshard.What do I need: public support. Please consider supporting me by doing one of the following:\*Learn about safe supply. According to BC's Chief Coroner, Lisa Lapointe, ""the subject-matter experts on the recent death review urgently recommended significant expansion of the safer supply in communities throughout the province to reduce the devastation caused by this public-health crisis."" As you will read, the Government is unanimous about the NEED for Safe Supply, but they are glacially slow in implementing and creating policies so that it not only works but doesn't end up in the wrong hands.  ([https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2021MMHA0035-001375](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2021MMHA0035-001375)). I have no doubt that a safe supply of drugs would have saved Aubrey's life.\*Come run or walk with me.  I'll be there every weekday starting October 3rd, from 11am until I finish. I'll be both running and walking. Do a leisurely lap of the block on your lunch hour or get in your 10k. Any support helps.\*Sit at my ""aid station"".

It's important to put pressure on politicians. Of course, there are other things to ask for in addition to safe supply.

I've made it public. \*follow me on StravaYou might be thinking--what's all this going to cost? Answer: it will cost whatever it costs to prevent your kids from dying of accidental drug poisoning.  If you think it can't happen to your kid, you need to look at the stats. The leading cause of death in British Columbians age 18-39 is toxic drug poisoning.  Aubrey was not a full time drug user. Last year, he graduated from Selkirk's Law and Justice program with awards. He sometimes used drugs.  But sometimes is enough.  We shut down the world to protect elderly and vulnerable people during the Covid pandemic, and that was the right thing to do.

I know this because I spent several hours doing this yesterday. 

I don't want to endorse a specific slate or group of candidates, so here's my long-list of my preferred ""left leaning"" candidates, listed in alphabetical order, with brief summaries of who endorsed them, any applicable work history/school involvement I was able to find, and anything that stood out on their websites aside from usual stuff about supporting students/etc.

Some general notes:

* all candidates support SOGI
* as most of the candidates running are in the 50+ demographic, I have noted if any of them currently have children in school or are under 40, aka ""young""
* GVTA = Greater Victoria Teacher's Association
* PAC = parent advisory council, each school has one
* Just because I don't mention something specifically doesn't mean the candidates don't value it (ie, covid safety) but if a candidate seemed particularly focused on something that other candidates were not (ie, music education) that is noted
* In the past term there has been a lot of controversy around selling school district land to make the budget work, appropriate use of school district land, cuts to the music program, and the very odd suspension of two trustees, Diane McNally and Robert Paynter. The school board was ordered to re-instate both these candidates. It was impossible for me to figure out exactly what happened without spending several more hours on research, but please note that BC courts decided the suspension was without merit and many groups that work with the school board were upset and troubled by it
* Voters need to pick 9 trustees for school district 61, there are more than 9 here, I think they would all do a good job, please read up on them yourselves to make a final selection

**Natalie Baillaut**  


* teacher on call, young, endorsed by GVTA

**Angela Carmichael**  


* spearheaded renaming George Jay elementary, vocal critic of previous school board drama, previous chair of Victoria Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils, former PAC member, endorsed by GVTA

**Sacha Christensen**  


* works for Randall Garrison's office, endorsed by Andrew Weaver, running specifically to bring younger voices to the board, young

**Mavis E David**  


* endorsed by GVTA, extensive work history as youth care worker, education program supervisor and youth care worker, BA of child care from UVIC

**Nicole Duncan**  


* endorsed by GVTA, former green party candidate, was on her PAC, former trustee

**Derek Gagnon**  


* endorsed by GVTA, lots of volunteer experience with cadets, concerned with transparency and accountability of school board

**Daphna Gelbart**  


* strong focus on covid safety, has young children in school

**Karin Kwan**  


* endorsed by GVTA, vocal supporter of music in schools, helped raise money to keep the elementary strings program going for another year

**Emily Mahbobi**  


* endorsed by GVTA, young, member of the arts scene

**Diane McNally**  


* endorsed by GVTA, was one of the trustees suspended by the previous board

**Kyle McStravick**  


* mentions COVID 19 safety, strong advocate for music, urban planner, seems to have the strongest concern about the sale of school district land to balance budgets in as much as that he feels a proper transparent policy needs to be in place guiding these decisions, young

I got super lucky (don't know how) and landed a studio apartment that was ridiculously affordable right off Fort Street. (Gave it up after a year to gamble on a cheaper room- ended up living with a hoarder from hell, but that's another story. I still hit myself for giving up the place.)

VictoriaBC,KeaganExtremeGaming,"Why I believe everyone should support a racetrack in the crd. Are race tracks louder than pickleball and smell like crap at times? YES, I'm not gonna argue that or that they are good for the environment but I do see them as an important part of an a region. Race tracks end up providing a safe place for enthusiasts to enjoy their vehicles and have fun with others whether its drifting, autocross, demo cars or whatever a race track provides a space where people can enjoy these activities without putting anyone else at risk or themselves in more danger. Imagine if your kids didnt have any parks or playgrounds to play in or the only option for sports is in the middle of the street. not having dedicated facilities simply makes things more dangerous. The people who do street racing and street drifting are simply idiots for not paying the small fees to do it where you wont put anyone else in risk and even get to talk to other members of the community. To be clear I'm not saying we should be subsidizing race tracks (which would be nice) but we need community support so we dont have to go 3 hours or goto the mainland every so often to enjoy our hobbies. Yes I know that saratoga wont be closing (atleast not rn that is) but some motorsports like drifting are incredibly hard on cars so every time you go to the event there's a chance you might break something so you would have to get a tow home which could cost a lot of money if you live on the south island and want a tow from saratoga. Sure you can just use a truck and trailer but not everyone has a use for a truck all the time or just cant afford a truck and a trailer that might only get used once a month. the beauty of western speedway being so close is that you can just go there after work on a weekday and have some fun then go home without a truck and trailer. yes we need to deal with climate change but trying to axe motorsports wont help. hopefully the people redeveloping the land western speedway sits on will decide that the track should stay or atleast the people running the track find a new location south of the malahat so the tradition of working during the day and motorsports after work can continue in the south island.",Community Plan to End Homelessness ,0,False,15.789473684210526

VictoriaBC,KindNebula,"Psycho landlord: Warning to renters in Gorge and Tillicum area Hi all!
I’m new to Reddit. 

I felt I should share this to help others out and hopefully prevent the possibility of anyone else having to go through what me and my partner have experienced since moving to Victoria. Basically, since we’ve moved here we’ve had an absolutely nightmare of an experience with our landlord who lives upstairs, and are pretty positive she’s done this to the last tenants as well as who knows how many others. 

To give a bit of a backstory, me and my partner both decided to move for the purpose of going to school here and to be closer to family. We began messaging a bunch of places and posting ads on both Craigslist and Kijiji looking for a 1 Bdrm suite when I got a text from a woman who claimed she had a basement suite available in the Gorge and Tillicum area. After introducing ourselves and texting for a while, we set up a meeting with her and ended up commuting across island to meet her in person and see the place. Now, although she seemed a little paranoid, we assumed it was due to the fact she is retired and lived alone, and assumed she would (as normal people usually do) relax a little once she realized we were trustworthy tenants. We decided to go forward and sign a 6 month lease. Big mistake...

Pretty much immediately after moving in on the 27th of December she started bothering us and would text me non-stop to complain about trivial things such as how I was parked in the driveway, so I apologized and started parking closer to the right of the house (her issue was that it was difficult to get the recycling out to the curb or something). But it didn’t end there. She began constantly coming downstairs and knocking on our door as well to complain. In one case it was that she could hear a buzzing noise from our space heater, which upon discovering what it was through looking past me in the doorway bothered her. She said since other tenants had never complained about the heat, she would likely have to “let us go” for having it. At times it was obvious she would come downstairs just stand outside of our door for no reason and listen to us as well. We should have known by the way she talked about her previous tenants; she claimed they drank all the time and smoked cigarettes and weed inside, causing her health problems which led her to go to the doctor, and the doctor then said there was nothing they could do and told her to take Benadryl and kick out her tenants. We never smelled anything in the suite, but assumed she was telling the truth obviously and trusted her for some reason. 

Now we see that they were likely tortured the same way we have been. As soon as we realized that she was overstepping boundaries and not leaving us alone by constantly knocking on our door, and after threatening to kick us out for having a space heater, I contacted the RTB. I was instructed to ask her via text to leave us alone and if she continued, to block her number. I followed this advice and wrote to her asking her to leave us alone, and ended up having to block her number. She then began harassing us and claiming that we were drinking all the time and smoking inside, both absolutely false. Neither of us smoke or are “drinkers”. We’re hardly ever home because we’re at school.

This woman has gotten worse and worse with us. She now just periodically comes downstairs and yells at us saying we’re smoking while my partner is watching tv and I’m studying or vice versa. She’s an absolute nutcase. I’ve filed a dispute, but the hearing isn’t until April. Directly after serving her papers, we received an eviction notice saying the EXACT same story she told us about her last tenants regarding smoking weed, cigarettes, the Benadryl, etc! So we’re fighting the notice until we find another place. In the meantime, I have PILES of evidence of her harassment. She literally leaves probably 2-3 notes on our door every other day, while yelling at us through our door during the evenings when she’s feeling bored. **I just don’t want anyone else to go through this. If an older “1950s” woman from Fiji offers you a place, RUN. She’s a psycho!**

I would also like to add that if you’re reading this and you were previous tenants at this place, please contact me if you can! I would love to talk to you.

VictoriaBC,Klondikecat,"I worked at BC Transit - Busline fielding complaints. Here's what they don't want you to know, any questions? I worked at BC Transit at the bus line call centre where I fielded complaints and helped peeps get on the right bus.  It was a debacle to put it kindly.  Management was grossly incompetent and there is zero accountability for the entire program.  It was really heart breaking to hear people missing job interviews, being late for work, late for class and dealing with the ramifications of an incompetent transit system.  I was the only person that actually rode the bus that I worked with!  And we all had free passes! So I actually had felt the anger and frustrations of the riders that called in unlike a lot of people working there.

There's honestly no point complaining to the people at the busline.  The busline employees are just there in place to provide the illusion that your complaints are being taken seriously.  They just pass your complaint on to another individual that has no ability to change anything.  They essentially monitor themselves for quality of service...it's ridiculous. (If you want to have your complaint taken somewhat seriously, and actually speak to management tell whomever you're calling that you want to speak to a supervisor now or you will be contacting a member of the media.)  There's a good chance that if you complain about a bus leaving 5 minutes early or if you mention that you didn't arrive 5 minutes early to your stop than your complaint won't even be logged!  It's absurd. 

Here are Some examples of gross negligence that I think are worth mentioning:

- In the ""Riders Guide"" there was a stat holiday that was listed as Saturday service.  A couple of days before that stat, management realized that they had actually scheduled all of the bus drivers for Sunday service on that holiday.  So what did they do? They just had the buses run on Sunday service! So I talked with people that didn't get buses all day because they obviously had not idea that management had just totally disregarded what was written in the guide.

- There are many mistakes in the maps and in the times provided in the Riders Guide.  I would contact the team that updates the guides and they would routinely not fix the guide. The errors would carry over one guide to another, despite the fact people would consistently miss buses or miss stops because of this. 

- Very frequently I would work overtime as would other departments just from management carelessly screwing up the schedule or just from them not wanting to go through the process of hiring new employees.  There are people at BC Transit consistently working 12-14 hours shifts at a base wage of around $30 an hour...yeah.  There were people that would joke about having $500 days.  I've never ever seen that anywhere else in my working experiences. 

The people of Victoria deserve better from their transit system.  BC Transit should work for you in more ways than one, and right now that just isn't the case.  The worst part of it all is that the people in our society that are the most vulnerable rely on our public transit.  If you have any questions please let me know and thank you to everyone that I spoke with during my time there.  The vast majority of the time people were reasonably upset at the system and showed me respect during our interactions and for that I'm most appreciative.

The Teal-Jones Group has government approval to log in different sections of TFL 46.

[According to the CBC,](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/fairy-creek-one-year-old-growth-logging-1.6157666) ""The Pacheedaht First Nation has signed a forest revenue-sharing agreement with the province and Chief Jeff Jones has asked the Fairy Creek protesters to leave, saying the nation is working on a resource stewardship plan that will guide forestry activities.""

However, there is a disagreement amongst members of the Pacheedaht First Nation. The blockade continues under invitation of Pacheedaht elder Bill Jones and hereditary chief Victor Peter.

""Pacheedaht Elder Bill Jones has a different point of view that has garnered extensive national and international media coverage. He has welcomed the protesters to Fairy Creek, urging people to continue to take direct action to stop all old-growth logging in his nation’s territory. “I implore people to continue to stand with me to protect our forests from destruction and colonialism because we need allies on the ground to stop old-growth logging in my home territory, and for my future generations and relatives,” Jones says in an interview with his niece, Kati George-Jim, who is from the T’Sou-ke First Nation and supports the blockades."" - An exerpt from [The Narwhal.](https://thenarwhal.ca/pacheedaht-fairy-creek-bc-logging/)

In a statement released on Aug. 19, the RCMP said: “We would caution anyone viewing these videos and reading comments to keep in mind that they do not capture the events and lengthy efforts (often hours) leading up to, or following the arrests or attempts of arrests of individuals.”

Sgt. Chris Manseau told CBC that people viewing videos online need ""to keep in mind that they do not fully capture the events leading up to or following the interactions.''

So I decided to dig up some context for all to see.


[Sgt. Chris Manseau stated, ""Prior to that short video that was posted online there was some pushing and shoving from the protesters that actually knocked over an RCMP officer... into a ditch area where [the officer was] knocked down and knocked unconscious,"" Police say his injuries were serious, but not life-threatening, and he spent two days in medical care.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-RrIDopPKY)



#Day of the pepper spray. August 21, 2021 Extended Footage:

[2](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jiYA1ziIWKg) - Journalist asks RCMP why some officers don't have visible badges and name tags.

[3](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jI0ZSfZU4L4) - Officer claims they extract protestors safely. Reporter can be heard reminding protestors to remain where they can legally protest.

[4](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AnKgl_Hqeuw) - Officer admits the protestors are lawfully allowed to be in the road and there will be no arrests.

[5](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-siK-xVA2mg) - The moments before the pepper spray. At 1:17 an officer seems to intentionally tap a woman on her genitals. 1:30 - 1:40 Alternate footage of the incident where the officer falls and is reportedly knocked unconscious. No protestor intentionally pushed them and they appear to move. 1:49 The fallen officer can clearly be seen moving his arms and head while attempting to get up. 2:09 - The officer starts to stand up.

[6](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gjLRuuHnUJ8&bpctr=1630253219) - Officers pull protestors from where they are legally allowed to stand in order to arrest them. Again at 0:32. At 0:53 the pepper spraying starts for seemingly no reason. At least 4 minutes and 16 seconds after the incident the RCMP claim was the reason for using pepper spray. Spraying and dragging people into the restricted area to be arrested continues. 3:15 - An officer cuts the backpack off of a protestor who is not resisting. For the next couple minutes more and more protestors are dragged into the restricted area and arrested. By 5:45 many officers are advancing well beyond where they said the protestors could legally stand as they continue the conflict with the retreating protestors.

[7](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=G6JVjUKtIDI) - A short clip of the aftermath.

[Alternate Footage](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KrlTUtfyH-A) - An extended version of the alternate footage that continues through the arrests and aftermath. 8:15 and on has descriptions of certain shots containing: pepper spraying in open mouths, seemingly unconscious people being dragged face down, police violating Justice Thompson's Supreme Court ruling and blocking public roads, claims that Teal-Jones is illegally blocking access to starve protestors of resources.

The protest has gone on for a year, the RCMP arrived the week of May 17, 2021 and is reportedly getting more violent. As of August 29, 2021 there have been over 800 arrests. Making it the second largest act of civil disobedience in Canadian history behind the ""War of the Woods"" Clayoquot Protests of 1993 with 900 arrests. The provincial NDP went back on their promise to protect the old growth. Regardless, that promise would have only paused logging old growth for two years. Two parties for the federal government of Canada have promised putting money towards protecting old growth with an election coming September 20, 2021. The Liberals promise $50m and the New Democratic Party promises $500m. So Teal-Jones is racing against the clock to try and cut it all down before it is properly protected.

Fairy Creek is one of the last remaining places with old growth in BC, Canada. Every forest here has already been logged and replanted. This isn't anti-logging. BC is covered in 2nd and 3rd generation(+) forests that can be logged. This is about saving the last of the 800-2000 year old trees that we have left.

VictoriaBC,LFrau,"Womens Basketball - drop-in/pick-up; assessing interest and seeking players Hi,

I'm in early stages of coordinating a dedicated women's drop-in basketball program at a gym in the Victoria area. It's ridiculous that places like Nanaimo and Kelowna have supported a women's league while Victoria remains totally void of opportunities.

Ideal scenario is:

* September start (to allow all summer for advertising, to hopefully get us into the Recreation Guides put out by local government, and so that people can return from vacation before this gets rolling)

* One weekday evening per week, ideally not conflicting with the VSSC's 5v5 basketball league to allow people to do both if they desire (currently, this rules out Wednesdays)

* Low-to-no-fee (likely result is charging the nominal ""drop in fee"" for the community centre or facility that we end up using, $2-$6)

* Anything from half-court 3v3 to full court 5v5 with a rotating 5-person team subbing in/kings court, depending on turnout.

* Somewhere in Saanich, Oak Bay, Victoria, or Esquimalt.

I played in the [Strathcona Womens Basketball League](http://www.swbl.ca/) in Vancouver for a few years before moving here, and that league started out as a women's drop-in that got so busy that a league resulted. Hopefully getting a well-established drop-in night here in Victoria will head us on a similar path.

As our boy Mister Rogers said, in times of need, look for the helpers.  We should all aspire to be that person.

I find myself in the unique position where my wife (an RN) is out of town working in remote First Nation's communities setting up their Pandemic Response so it's just me and the cat right now.  And as much as he loves me being at home all day every day, I should be doing more for the community than watching CBC and 

Nothing will go against community rules, laws, etc and I will be practicing social distancing.  

I have created this account fresh today, as no doubt someone will point out, however, let's combat that with full disclosure.  My name is Laurence Glover, I've been a a Realtor here in Victoria for 17 years, and I will give my personal cell number to those that ask for help, which can be verified very easily by mods if the desire.  

Now to the goods:

 If you need someone to: 

* Pickup groceries or prescriptions 
* Post mail 
* Pick up urgent supplies 
* Check in periodically 
* Help with setting up Skype/WhatsApp or any other video calling or messaging software on your phone or computer so you can stay in touch with family 
* Just need someone to reach out to with a friendly phone call/text/email on occasion 

Then please get in touch and I’ll do my best to assist wherever possible.  

To keep this all above board and hold everyone accountable, I ask that you please make a separate reply in here with what help you need and I will PM you so that you don't have to give your personal information out publicly.

If anyone can think of anything to add here, please do.  If you find yourself able to help as well, shoot me a PM.  As with this virus, life is very liquid and changing by the hour but I'd like to help out where/when I can.

Cheers, and please stay safe.

I'm going to be riding my bike from Vancouver over to the Island, and along the Galloping Goose up to the potholes on Saturday. Hoping to grab a campsite. But since management/ownership was transferred, details on the place are scant.

VictoriaBC,Legitimate_Use2675,"Barometric and altitude migraines Hello, I am wondering if anyone can help me out with Migraines here?!

I am thinking of moving to Victoria, BC, right now I am living in the Kingston/Ottawa, Ontario area and I have had migraines off and on depending on the barometric pressure it seems.  When a storm is be brewing way before you even see the wind coming, I would wake up tension in my neck, mostly the left side, sometimes nausea, sometimes pounding on my head.  I pretty much know when it is going to rain or if it might rain, but then it doesn't.

Same with temperature drops, when it is very cold in the winter here, I also get migraines/tension headaches.

I also seem to suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), where I need sun to survive or else I am depressed and Isolate to stay away from the gloomy weather.

When the Fall hits around end of September,  I start to get extreme pressure headaches and I want to pound my head against the wall.  This pain goes for more than a month, but I learned to deal with it by lying down and doing nothing!  Even in the summer can get these headaches if it is very humid and there is no sun and/or rain may be coming.

I figured out it must be from the changes in barometric pressure.  I had moved to Calgary a while back and I was getting altitude sickness, where I would turn white and want to faint, with a really bad headache and nausea. I have been wanting to move somewhere more dry and away from snow for a very long time.  I am of Greek decent and have considered going back to Greece, but I wanted to stay in Canada, so I found the closest to Greek weather is Vancouver Island.  I am wondering if anyone knows if moving to Vancouver Island would help me more than in Ontario, based on barometric pressure changes and altitude?  Maybe a certain part of the island is better than another for migraine/tension headache prevention?  Do you think from your experience that I would enjoy living in Vancouver Island more, or would it be the same?

I also have a small child and I am a single mother who has sole decision making they call it now (previously called full custody), so I need to figure out legally how to move out of province as well and I am not sure if quality of life for myself is a good reason.  I honestly cannot live like this anymore as it is affecting me and my child.  She also has Lymes Disease and has symptoms everyday as well.

We both found when we left the harsh winter here in ontario and went to a sunny location for 10 days that all of our symptoms went away and the strange thing was that we drove through really high mountains and the weather at our destination was still really cold, but there was no snow and lots of sun and even rain,  but we had not symptoms and we were on the Atlantic.  I seem to feel the same when I go to Greece, we go through high mountains and our ears pop, but when I stay there I do not get headaches.  I know Greece is a very dry place, but it rains instead of snows, kind of like Vancouver Island.  Greece is also near the Sea and where I stay is usually around the sea.  I have also stayed there for a month that was extremely humid and still no headaches.  The only time I did not stay in Greece was from Fall to Spring, so this is why I am wondering if I can handle a rainy winter in Vancouver Island rather than a snowy winter here in Ontario?

VictoriaBC,LegoAddictedAtheist,"Picking a neighbourhood based on middle and secondary schools: Looking for opinions. I know there have been other posts asking about good areas to live in the Greater Victoria Area, but everyone has their own criteria for a good area.  What's most important to me is making sure my daughter has the best possible chance at a positive experience in school for the next few years.  She will be starting middle school in September, and I would like to buy a house that is reasonably close to good middle and secondary schools. 

What schools would you recommend, and what schools would you absolutely stay away from?  I can't afford a private school so I'm looking at public schools only.  Bonus points if a school is known for having programs that would appeal to a kid who loves science.  A makers club or robotics club would be a great fit for her.  If a school (or neighbourhood) is known for it's cliques and a less than welcoming atmosphere, I'd like to know so that I can avoid it.  You will find drugs in every school, but if a school is known to have a problem with crystal meth, that's obviously a deal breaker.

My gf and I are upcoming students at UVic and found a place back in late May. The place seemed super legit. It was on Pandora Ave and the ad was for a one bedroom for $1800 everything included. 

After a few email exchanges we both met “Allan Wellington” the landlord and viewed the unit. He showed us around (using a fob), was super friendly and had an entire story built around the place. Him and his sister bought the place as an investment after moving here from Toronto with him living across the road and his sister nearby as well. He asked for basic information such as previous landlord and employer references but did not actually take our last paychecks we were using to prove our income. He actually called these references that night and the next day said we got the place. 

We went over to the lobby of where he supposedly lived across the road from our new place. He again fobbed us in and we signed our legit looking lease with him in the lobby. We took pictures of it and gave him $900 for the deposit in cash (yes red flag). On the lease he had his address as the building’s address we were in and supposedly his full name.

Flash forward to yesterday we had been in contact with Allan off and on confirming the move in date of August 13th. We packed up our U-Haul and drove from Edmonton to Victoria over two days. He wished us save travels and said he couldn’t wait to see us. Also asked for the first months prorated rent be paid in cash and subsequent payments be made by e-transfer. My gf made it to the bottom of our new place ahead of me by a few minutes and gave Allan the months rent after receiving the fobb and keys. Said his niece and nephew were coming and would pop back over once we settled in for a walk through. Also was again very calm and friendly stating that he was glad we made it and even got us a welcome home package with wine inside. 

About 10min later we started to realize this was an elaborate scam as the fobb and mail keys did not work. Tried calling and texting to no avail with calls not even going through anymore. Found a way to our supposed unit and the key fit but didn’t turn and no one answered the door. We even went across the street to his supposed address but no one by his name lived there.

Police still haven’t shown up several hours later and will likely deal with them tomorrow morning. Any advice? Any similar sounding stories we can tell the police? “Allan” is a white male average height in his 30s who always wore grey “news boy”? hat and a grey cloth mask.

Of course the CofV refuses to make this change because we live in a building with 4 units and ""each unit is issued a bin"".

VictoriaBC,Lovecompassionpeace,"Educational moment regarding race questions Update: Thank you to everyone who has responded in a positive manner, you are amazing!  I had originally turned off post replies because I didn't want to get sucked into what this could've turned into but I'm happy to see the negative replies are rare.  I'm also sorry to read some people's negative experiences, I'm sorry that happened to you and I hope sharing your experience has helped you in some way or another.  Those are things no one should experience, especially in this day and age.  

No, I don't go looking for racist people, trust me that would be a very very difficult way to live. But sometimes, some people make it so blatantly obvious that it's hard to ignore.  I'm born and raised in Canada and lived in multiple places across the country, I've experienced a lot.  My previous post (now deleted) had a question about POC possibly being treated a certain way in certain neighbourhoods in Victoria because of the lack of diversity. A couple of people chose to berate me for that which is why I chose to make this post.  If you aren't going to let me ask a simple question regarding something that effects my day to day life, YOU are creating a further divide because YOU are too uncomfortable with that conversation.  It's grown on me enough to know some things are just the way they are and we shrug our shoulders and move on.  Having the conversation creates more knowledge.  I'm sure there are people who skimmed this post and the replies and even if an ounce of reflection occurs, something can be shifted for the better.  Allow these conversations to happen!  It helps us understand each other.  If you feel called out or personally attacked, well, maybe there's a reason your conscious is so irritated.  Lastly, please don't compare Canada to somewhere in Europe or compare a white person going to India or China and being treated differently.  NOT THE SAME AT ALL! (Yes there is racism everywhere but that comparison makes zero sense for Canada).  Non POC still came here from somewhere.  My ancestors just came here a little later than yours, but we're all immigrants so a little compassion goes a long way!

&#x200B;

I've seen this multiple times now so let's have a discussion.  I have posted (and deleted because I needed to for my mental health) and seen other posts where people get so triggered with talk of race. And these are simple questions like hey, how do you get treated out there as a POC? Because coming from the lower mainland where a group of brown people definitely get treated a certain way at a restaurant, I think this question is reasonable.

As a POC this is our reality.  It is a fact that our skin colour will automatically warrant a specific type  of treatment from people.  As someone who's not completely familiar with the area, I will ask questions that reference this.  If it makes you uncomfortable, don't reply. Do not reply with further ignorant gaslighting comments.  For sense of comfort and yes safety as well, these questions need to be asked by POC, homosexuals, anyone that is ""different"" especially in a challenging climate where people seem more hostile now than before the pandemic.

Yes, we live in Canada which is a diverse beautiful nation, but it's also home to a lot of racism and stereotyping.  No there aren't any pitch forks and Nazi symbols, but it is still a very predominately white country with certain pockets of diversity.  Victoria is small.  Victoria is still predominately white.  I will ask questions for me to better assess things.  If you don't like it, just ignore me.  Scroll past my post.

VictoriaBC,MW250,"Victoria police non-emergency calls hit by ‘major, major delays’ https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/victoria-police-non-emergency-calls-hit-by-major-major-delays-1.24012018

People placing non-emergency calls to Victoria police are waiting up to 40 minutes to get through due to delays at E-Comm’s dispatch centre, Chief Del Manak says.

Manak was questioned about the ongoing problems during an appearance before Victoria city council to discuss his department’s 2020 budget. Coun. Marianne Alto said she and others have been hearing concerns about the length of time it’s taking for people to report incidents.

“Recently, I think we’re all becoming aware that there’s been some frustration around E-Comm and the time it’s taking to respond to some of the calls for service,” she said.

Manak said the issue stems from the switch to E-Comm’s South Island 911 Police Dispatch Centre. Victoria police transitioned its emergency and non-emergency call-taking and dispatch services to the centre on Jan. 22. Saanich and Oak Bay police departments transitioned a week later.

“The transition has been less than smooth and there are some major, major delays, especially the non-emergency line where people are put on hold for sometimes upward of 40 minutes,” Manak told council.

He acknowledged in a later interview that the situation is frustrating for the public.

“Many people are now hanging up and guess where they’re showing up?” he said. “They’re coming down to the police station to say: ‘I can’t get through. But I’ve got this incident I want to report.’ Or: ‘My house got broken into while I was on holidays last week. So my house is safe, but I’ve got stuff all over the place and I’ve got to report because [of] my insurance company.’ ”

He said the situation puts the department’s reputation at risk.

“Of course, the public is getting frustrated with the police because they think it’s us that’s not providing the good service, but it’s actually E-Comm,” he said.

Oak Bay Police Chief Andy Brinton confirmed that his department has been dealing with challenges around wait times for non-emergency calls as well.

“I must say that the overall service from E-Comm has been highly professional and the E-Comm management group have responded to any concerns we have raised,” he said. “We are currently working together to enhance their service to Oak Bay and to address any of the service gaps that may have occurred.”

E-Comm, which is owned by the municipalities and public safety agencies that it serves, dispatches for more than 30 police departments on the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island.

Jasmine Bradley, E-Comm’s corporate communications manager, said staff respond to both emergency and non-emergency calls.

“Emergency calls are always the priority, which is part of the reason we have seen longer wait times on non-emergency [calls], as our staff focus on helping people who need immediate assistance from police,” she said in an email.

“While we can’t eliminate wait times altogether, our goal is to shorten the time it takes to speak with our call takers, so we can provide the most responsive service possible to the public.”

Bradley said E-Comm is recruiting more staff to help with call volumes, while providing information to the public about how to minimize waits. The front page of the Victoria police department’s website, for instance, links to a message from E-Comm that states: “We know waiting to report your non-emergency situation can be frustrating.” The page offers a series of tips for getting speedier service, such as placing non-emergency calls in the early morning or evening, and having your driver’s licence and other relevant information ready when placing a call.

... 

The union representing emergency call-takers and dispatchers says E-Comm is “desperately underfunded” as an organization.

“That lack of funding has made it very difficult for us in bargaining to resolve a lot of issues we have, such as excessive overtime, missed breaks, burnout and high attrition,” said Matthew Bordewick, who chairs Emergency Dispatchers of B.C. CUPE Local 873-02.

“But it also has raised concerns about these wait times and the sustainability of this career and wanting to have that proper funding in place to keep providing that excellent service that our 911 operators provide to the public and officers on the road.”

The union has been without a contract for more than 10 months and talks with E-Comm are at an impasse, Bordewick said.","Emergency Housing , front line, front line worker, Service provider , Sooke Transition House Society, Victoria Native Friendship Centre ",1,False,0.0

When he first started showing up, he looked ROUGH. Skin and bones, lots of wounds and sores, all that. Because I'm a huge sucker with a house full of cats, I've set up shelter on my porch for him and I've been feeding him as well, and he looks a thousand times better now.

The issue is he's still terrified of people. If I'm very slow and cautious he'll sit within a few feet of me but any movements and he's gone-he'll come up to my front door and peek through, but when I walk outside with food he hunkers under whatever he can and waits until I set the food down then go back inside. 

I'll be honest, I don't have the training or knowledge to rehabilitate a feral cat and, even if I did, I already have 5 other cats and all but one came into my life under a similar circumstance.

This is a long, long shot, but I’m going to give it one anyway: 

*** Victoria, B.C. ***

Sometime in 2011 (not sure when - could have been anywhere from January to September), Kris and I were on a late-night walk around Quadra & McKenzie when we heard music.  Specifically, we heard ‘Careless Whisper’ by George Michael. 

We followed the sound, and discovered a band of humans in the underground parking lot of the Saanich Centre. They were playing live and seemed to be shooting footage for something.  We spied on them for a few seconds, crouched between a bush and the parking garage window, and when they spied us back, they motioned for us to come down.  We hopped down. They kept playing, the camera kept rolling.  I think we danced. I’m pretty sure we did. 

Ever since that night, and especially since Kris died, I’ve wondered if this footage exists somewhere. I’ve scoured YouTube but haven’t come across anything. The band was really good, and I remember there being a saxophone (or a trumpet? Some kind of brass!)

On the off chance that someone I know might be friends with a friend of someone in this band who played that night in the parking lot beneath London Drugs, I would love to get in touch.  To see if any footage exists, or just to confirm that this strange and slightly blurry memory is based on an actual event and not a dream.  If those other folks can find “Dave from Vancouver Island” from 1969, maybe I can find the Careless Whisper parking garage band from 2011.

VICTORIA - 

A Victoria tattoo artist pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault Friday.

David Samuel Hadden, 36, was arrested on Aug. 19 as police investigated [reports of sexual violence](https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/victoria-tattoo-artist-charged-in-alleged-sex-assaults-1.5073118) against women during tattoo appointments in Victoria.

The Victoria police investigation began in July after multiple women shared allegations of sexual assault on social media.

The online allegations prompted one victim, who had reported an assault to VicPD but did not file charges at the time, to come forward again and renew her case.

The BC Prosecution Service said Friday the judge ""has ordered a pre-sentence report which is to include a psychological assessment.""

The matter is due back in court on Jan. 27 to review the report and fix a date for sentencing, the prosecution service said.

In July, Carne Tattoo said on social media it was [shocked by the allegations](https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/victoria-tattoo-artist-fired-after-allegations-of-sex-assaults-1.5017835) against Hadden and had fired him.

I ended up going with Hudson Place Dental because it’s within walking distance of me. I had my appointment this morning and it went great! 1000000x better experience than I ever had at my old dentist in Ontario. 



The hygienist was super nice, communicative, and made me feel really comfortable. It was still brutal having to deal with the sounds of scraping inside my mouth but it was bearable! The dentist was also incredible and actually took the time to walk through the x-rays with me and walk through photos he took during his exam of possible problem areas to keep an eye on. I’ve never had a dentist actually sit and explain stuff like that so it was great!

Who will benefit?  Developers.  Who will suffer?  We will, with more crowding, fewer gardens, fewer trees, more noise, more traffic, more gridlock.

Consider:

1) Victoria already has a lot of housing for its size.  According to [Stats Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/220209/t004a-eng.htm) Victoria has the 7th highest popuation density in Canada.  Vancouver is #1.  All that housing has only made prices go higher.    
2) Victoria *cannot* meet demand. Building more housing will not lower prices.  Why?  Because the demand for housing far exceeds the ability of Victoria to provide housing.  Just last year, *just in 2022*, BC added enough new people to create a city the size of Abbotsford - [147,540](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/statistics/people-population-community/population/quarterly_population_highlights.pdf) new residents.  That's nearly double the number of people that live in Victoria

VictoriaBC,MilkyPirate,"BC Transit Fare Review [Survey here](https://engage.bctransit.com/victoria-fare-review)

BC Transit is looking for community engagement for their fare review.  Apparently they haven't changed fares in a decade, so it's time for transit fares to increase (along with everything else, oof).  Below are the fare pages of other major cities (most of which have rail or ferry service) if you want to do some comparisons of the proposed increases against other transit services.  I don't have the information handy for the breakdowns/percentages of how the fares fund the different services, but it helps to paint the picture of what other cities are offering for the cost.

My issues with the survey: 

1.  It does not provide any insight on the plans to meet the ""potential service hours gained"".  More hiring campaigns?  Bonuses?  MOUs for raises?  Buy more buses?  Offer more routes?  

2. The revenue shown as ""$"" or ""$$$$"" is.... sure it gets a point across but on earth does it **actually** mean?? 

It was a quick survey to fill out (although not terribly user friendly - it's hard to reference their graphic and rate the options at the same time).  We all know our transit is suffering, and there needs to be more funding coming (*with some good planning as well*) from many angles to support the development of transit in Victoria.  I'm fortunate enough that these increases won't make or break my access to transit, and they all strike me and overall reasonable so please use the survey and share how this affects your access to transit!

My partner works in the downtown core, very close to our dear parliament building (within a block), and yesterday while he was at work from 10-7, he parked his '98 Malibu in the street parking directly in front of the Clipper Vacations terminal on Belleville road. There are multiple cars, police vehicles and pedestrians who are constantly passing this spot, especially on a nice day.  
At 7pm when he got off of work, he exited to discover no car. He called the tow-truck company just in case, who confirmed that they did not have it.

VictoriaBC,MrG,"Opinions on West Shore - Victoria Real Estate & Schools Hello /r/VictoriaBC.  My wife and our two daughters are looking to move to the Greater Victoria area... oh no, you're thinking: yet another moving thread.

Well yes this is another moving thread, but I've searched and read many posts, like how [Sooke is a nice area but forget about it if you have to commute to Victoria](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/7rdufl/my_husband_and_i_are_looking_to_buy_our_first/) and [this thread which discusses how the type of commuting in Victoria is much worse than other places in Canada](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/7s29yu/yet_another_moving_to_victoria_post_east_sooke_vs/).  For general neighborhood info I read how Esquimalt generally isn't looked upon well, although several posters vehemently disagree with that assessment.  

So the posts I've seen have been helpful but I'm hoping to get some specific advice from those of you who know Victoria really well to see if what I'm currently thinking of is on target for us.  Of note, in a few weeks we'll be in Victoria for a week to try to immerse ourselves in the area as much as possible. (My wife and I have been to Victoria before, our children have not.)  And if we do move, we're also seriously considering renting for 1 year before deciding, but even with high real estate prices both my wife and I have never been a fan of renting and rental prices are extremely high as well.

As for our situation:

* I'm in IT and I work exclusively out of my house, so in general commuting isn't a huge concern of mine.  I do need to travel every 1-2 months and generally I'm of the opinion the closer you are to the main core of the city, the better (even though there are some very, very tempting properties in Sooke... especially since commuting isn't a big concern.)

* For the upcoming 2018 school year, my daughters will be going into Gr 9 and 11.  The opinion from my buddie's GF, who is a Victoria police officer and has lived in Victoria for decades, is that for West Shore, Royal Bay Secondary in Colwood is good, but that we should avoid Esquimalt High and Belmont Secondary.

* My eldest has her eye on law school at the University of Victoria, so an eventual commute for her to UVic is something we may want to ensure isn't too burdensome for her.

* Our housing budget is 750-900K - and we love trees and green.  There doesn't have to be a ton of trees but new developments with nary a tree to be found isn't going to work for us.  

Based on what my friend's GF said there are plenty of good high schools in Victoria and immediately north.  Reynolds, Oak Bay High etc.  But for what I've seen for sale, the old, small and very expensive homes in Victoria/Saanich etc. just aren't a good fit for us.  For the type of home we'd like to purchase (3 bedrooms plus a guest room, high end kitchen, trees etc.) we'd be looking at well over $1million.  So my search has expanded outward.

Sooke has great homes in our price range but it seems to be too far flung.  However the Colwood neighborhood and surrounding areas seems to be a decent fit for our budget and wish-list.  

What's the consensus: Is Colwood and surrounding area a good fit for us or am I missing any neighborhoods that we should consider?  Thanks in advance to those who spend time giving helpful feedback!

VictoriaBC,Muskwatch,"B&E followed by some Sweet Sweet Justice. So, day before yesterday evening myself and some friends got back to where we were staying to discover that it had been burgled, and not by no cat. About six grand worth of stuff was missing, including my backpack. The crooks thought it was their lucky day, but little did they know that THE TRIUMVIRATE OF JUSTICE was about to rain on their pitiful parade. Unbeknownst to them, there was more than standard issue tracking software installed on the i-pad they had surreptitiously swiped, and though they thought their tracks were covered, they stood out loud and clear. After the constabulary had assessed the damage, two friends and myself headed out to stake out the apartment building pegged as the probably lair of these Victorian ne'er-do-wells. We checked all the dumpsters in the area, and looked in all the vehicles, but turned up nothing, and the i-pad was no longer giving us a location. Nevertheless, we resolved to return in the early morning hours, should these criminals attempt to leave the premises with our property. At five a.m. our local eye in the sky tech wizard a.k.a. Oracle, informed us of movement, so six a.m. found us at yet another location, where through some diligent police work, one friend thought she saw a familiar vehicle from the night before, and a closer observation revealed her backpack in the back seat. At that point we called in the locals to take out the trash, which they did - arresting a handful of individuals, seizing a pair of villainous vehicles (we laughed as they were towed), and gaining access to an apartment frequented by a malicious band of (reputed) meth-dealing miscreants (in Esquimalt). Sweet sweet justice. The story continues to unfold, and a lot of property has yet to be recovered, but rest assured that when trouble strikes, WE may just possibly be there. ready. waiting.  All in all a better ending than we were expecting.

Edit: [here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/HSkb5.jpg) of the backpack that was taken - it has more beading on now, but easily recognizable!

I'm currently struggling with a contagious skin disease that requires I keep my hair very short, and while I've been told other people can protect themselves by wearing gloves and/or thorough hand washing, I'm having trouble finding a local hair dresser willing to deal with it. I can understand that, but due to a separate medical issue I have a lot of trouble cutting my own hair (I already blew out a clipper set).


I feel like there must be haircutters in the area who have experience with medical issues and would be okay dealing with this kind of thing, but I can't find any by searching. Does anybody know if they exist and where I could find them? I'm in the west shore but at this point I'm desperate enough to go as far as Sidney if necessary.


**Update:** Got a discounted clipper set from CT and managed it myself on a good day with some family help, but it's definitely something I could only do occasionally and not on a regular basis.

Spotify recommended the album on for my morning bike commute and was pleasantly surprised to see Victoria on the track list so I put it on as I rode through Fernwood/Oaklands this morning and it's pretty nice! Typical Mac instrumental but I think I felt a bit of Victoria energy.

He's released the GPS location for every song on the album on his twitter but I wonder what part of town people feel when they hear this? (No peeking!). I was getting vibes of a nice ride from James Bay into a Beacon Hill Park before accidentally stumbling into an informal tent encampment!

VictoriaBC,NMH1701,"Walmart, Mask Policies, and the community in the eyes of a Walmart Associate. This may be considered a ""spiking drama"" thing, however know this is written from heart with the intent to raise awareness and caring for those in the region of Langford. I am an associate in the Langford Walmart, and I have been making interesting observations. Here's my thoughts:

Shoppers will take any opportunity to take their masks off. Bathrooms, when using a phone, opening and consuming merchandise of one sort or another (Or pre-purchased food product)

Wipes, and disposable masks! A lot of people use wipes to clean their carts, and leave them AND their disposable masks in carts! I am one of those people who pushes carts on occasion (not as a primary role) and it's disgusting, seeing people leaving their masks and wipes in the carts. There's garbage cans all over the store and even two outside the main entries! Please take an extra 20 seconds to properly dispose of them!

Carts in the lot! There's cart corrals for a reason. You want to get in, get your groceries, and go home. I get it! But please, PLEASE spend an extra minute or so to place your cart in the designated spots!

Merchandise! If you decide you don't want something, ESPECIALLY IF IT'S PERISHABLE, can you please take a bit of extra time to at the least find and give the items to an associate, if not take it back to it's home? Every item that you leave on the salesfloor creates more and more work for us to do. The store is, as most Walmarts are, short staffed. Every little bit helps. Items placed randomly on shelves need to be sent back to their homes, and perishable items (eg. milk) have to be thrown away and written off as disposed of. It builds up!

Masks! There's not many actual disabilities that cause you to be incapable of wearing a mask. We have associates that have asthma that wear masks. We have an elderly women with COPD, who is on oxygen, and she wears a mask. If you hate the fact that your mask fogs up, take the time to find and purchase a face shield, either the full face of the little cup-like ones that just cover your nose and mouth.

Masks are not a conspiracy theory. They're not a way for the government to control you. Masks are there to both **help** protect you and to help **you** protect others. They aren't 100% perfect. They don't block everything. But risks drop RADICALLY when you wear one. The biggest thing to a mask is the sense of safety it provides. Again, I'm a retail worker. I recently saw a women wandering around the store without a mask, yelling at the manager that was forced to eject her. What happens if she caught COVID? Then that manager and everyone who came near her would quite likely be infected too! Masks are the best thing that can be provided to you to keep you safe, and if you don't like wearing one...If an elderly woman with COPD can wear one, in almost all cases, so can you!

I will pay consistent attention to this post and answer any questions and respond to messages as they come, given availability.

Do your civil duty to this town, this region, and keep us safe in the many ways you can! #stayCOVIDsafe!  


Edit - the point of this isn't to complain about COVID actions and the people surrounding it but rather the mindset of some shoppers and their often very impolite treatment of the environment and employees of the store, most specifically surrounding cleanliness but with a major point being a distinct drop of respect to the individual during COVID.",Point in Time,0,False,0.0

VictoriaBC,NapalmTheRabbit,"Physical threats from roommate, what rights do I have? For reference, this is currently happening to my SO. She lives with a handful people in a rented house and, as far as I know, she's the 'house leader'. I'm unsure of what binding contract she has with the landlord, but she's been the delegated leader and is responsible for paying the rent in full (collecting rent from other tenants) and has been the primary correspondent with him on all house matters.         



She recently let a new tenant in as an old one left. This tenant signed the lease (something only my SO had done) and everything was fine until the house democracy came to voting on another new tenant (as a second is leaving shortly). The newest tenant went nuclear, as she'd made arrangements for her friend to take the open room behind the rest of the house's back. Cue harassment on social media (calling my SO out, challenging her, telling people she's a snake and making comments about her appearance) and ultimately telling people close to my SO that she planned on 'breaking her fucking neck'.          



There was one previous event with a tenant, as my SO has led the house for a year now, which ended with them leaving civilly. The current tenant is threatening legal action because she believes my SO doesn't have the power to evict her. I'm totally uncertain if her 'leader'ship status has any weight legally, but she does have sway over the landlord and threats of violence and online harassment certainly fulfill the one-month-eviction criteria of ""jeopardizing the health and safety of other tenants"".

I currently work as a custom woodworker, a lot of heritage work, and do some light carpentry on the side. Lots of experience in the hospitality industry, and management as well. 

Cost of living in my province has gotten out of control.  Google says a 1bedroom is 1000-1300 but realistically it's 1500-2000 and up. So I know what I've looked up isn't accurate.  

This might not seem like much but  it's almost pushing double what it was a few years ago. Worst thing is wages are still what they were a few years ago. The vacancy rate is one of the lowest if not lowest in the country, and forget about buying a home anytime soon. The housing market here is even more messed up.

Victoria seems like a good place to live and has more work in my industry. My research shows Victoria rent would cost around 1500-1900. Is that really accurate. Would 25-35/hr be a decent wage to live on your own?

The heat wave will be worse and last longer in California where there are already large fires.

Please note that I am not a professional nor an academic but just a geek interested in weather and climate. Also I do not know if/how any of these sites work on phones.

There may be no smoke now but you might want to bookmark this page for a later date if you see the horizon turn yellow and think you smell smoke. 

The main issue for us in Victoria is wind direction as the fires will be in the interior or down south. Normally the winds are in our favor but that is not always the case. Watch this video of a smoke plume from a current California fire expand across hundreds of kilometers and head in our direction in a matter of hours.

VictoriaBC,Netcentrica,"Wildfire Smoke, Air Quality and Heat Risk info **Wildfire Smoke and Air Quality**

Well unfortunately we have a new regular season we didn’t have when I was a kid growing up in Victoria sixty-odd years ago – the wildfire smoke and heat wave season - which may start any day now because most of the fire smoke in Victoria comes from elsewhere. For example you can see via the link below how the smoke from the current Alberta wildfires reaches all the way to the United States east coast. 
https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/this-map-shows-just-how-far-alberta-wildfire-smoke-has-reached-1.6390695 

Please note that I am not a professional nor an academic but just a geek interested in weather and climate. Also I do not know if/how any of these sites work on phones.

There may be no smoke now but you might want to bookmark this page for that later date when you see the horizon turn yellow or think you smell smoke.

The main issue for us in Victoria is wind direction as the fires will be in the interior, down south or up island. Normally the winds are in our favor but that is not always the case. If you’re new here you may not know that smoke from elsewhere can get so bad here as to make normal functioning difficult and be a real health risk to vulnerable people. 

Below are some handy ways of seeing wildfire smoke related information. Note that some of these sites will flash their images at first but that will stop after a few seconds once all the images are loaded. 

We'll start simple with the official Environment Canada current Air Quality Index and forecast for Victoria.

**Heat Risk**

**On June 28, 2021 the temperature reading at Victoria’s Gonzales Point hit 39.8 degrees.** There were sixteen heat-related deaths in Victoria over the course of that particular heat wave. So yes, it can happen here. 

I’ll be seventy this year and I’ve lived in Victoria for about sixty of those years. I’ve seen the climate here steadily warming. The weather forecasters are already warning 2023 could be a particularly warm summer. 
https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/climate-experts-el-nino-bc

Here is a BC Gov website with all kinds of good info about what to do before and during  a heat wave... 

https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-management/preparedbc/know-your-hazards/severe-weather/extreme-heat 

...and the related BC Centre for Disease Control site http://www.bccdc.ca/health-professionals/professional-resources/heat-event-response-planning

However as shown in the film series linked below the main danger is that as you get hotter you become increasingly confused and make worse and worse decisions. All the things that could go wrong are detailed in this series. 

**The series is intended as educational material, not entertainment**, something I know because I have corresponded with the producers. I am a strong supporter of this approach because I believe people learn and remember best from stories. 

This series shows what happens to people during a fictional heat wave in Amsterdam. It  will help you understand what you and your neighbors might go through in a worst case scenario. Infants, pregnant women, pets, the elderly. It is in Dutch with subtitles and each of the the twelve episodes is less than ten minutes long. Some swearing and suggestive scenes. It's Amsterdam after all.

**NOTE**

Although my intention with this post was simply to provide information to those with possible concerns over wildfire smoke or heat events in Victoria it is not surprising that the discussion has spilled over into opinions regarding the wider issue of climate change. If you are concerned about the impacts of climate change in our region the “Future Impacts” section of this BC Government webpage will be of interest.

Anyway, at this time there are no firm plans for where a rally point in Vancouver might be. On top of that, the organizers seem to be planning to split the convoy up on the 20th, with some (the the majority?) of convoy participants headed to the border, with others headed to Victoria.

VictoriaBC,Nexteri,"Looking for coastal redwoods in Victoria! If you like trees as much as I do, you are probably aware of the incredible redwoods that we have here in Victoria. We have incredible, 150 foot (\~45 m) tall [Giant Sequoias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoiadendron_giganteum) (sequoiadendron giganteum) such as the one in [Irving Park](https://www.focusonvictoria.ca/victoria-mapping-project/history/irving-park/), as well as Victoria's tallest and biggest tree at [Moss and Richardson](https://vancouverislandbigtrees.blogspot.com/2012/12/largest-tree-in-victoria-bc-is-giant.html?m=1).

I am currently in the process of mapping these giant sequoias, having already catalogued the location of over 100 giant sequoias and counting. But that's not what I'm here to talk about!

Did you know that here in Victoria, [Beacon Hill Park](https://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/residents/parks/beacon-hill.html) specifically, we have 8 [Dawn Redwoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasequoia_glyptostroboides) (metasequoia glyptostroboides), a species of redwood that has not grown in North America for over *2 million* years.

A quick biology lesson: Giant sequoias, of the sequoiadendron [genus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus), as well as dawn redwoods, of the metasequoia genus, are two of the three [genera](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genera#Noun) of the [Sequoioideae subfamily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoioideae). The third genus, [Sequoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_(genus)), which like the other two only has one [extant](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/extant#Adjective) species, the [Coastal Redwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_sempervirens) (sequoia sempervirens), are currently the tallest trees in the world. [Hyperion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(tree)), the tallest living tree in the world measuring at 115.85m , or 380.1 feet, is a coastal redwood in California's [Redwood National Park](https://www.nps.gov/redw/index.htm).

So, we know that Victoria likely has hundreds of giant sequoias, as well as a few dawn redwoods in beacon hill park, but I am yet to see a single costal redwood in Victoria. Habitat wise, given that Victoria is habitable for both the giant sequoias and dawn redwoods, you could assume that coastal redwoods would also be able to grow (to some extent) in our moist, *coastal* habitat. Wouldn't it be amazing if you could go and see each of the three types of redwoods *right here in Victoria*?

So now, I ask for your help! If you know of any coastal redwoods in Victoria, let me know! Feel free to PM me or leave a reply under this post. Let's celebrate these amazing, endangered trees!

If you want help on how to identify these trees, try [this WikiHow article](https://www.wikihow.com/Identify-a-Redwood-Tree), or try clicking on the hyperlinks for each respective tree species. For further information, try the wonderful and local [Vancouver Island Big Trees Blog](https://vancouverislandbigtrees.blogspot.com/), or, of course, feel free to ask me about any questions you have.

Edit: I have now confirmed the locations of one coastal redwood in Uvic's [Finnerty Gardens](https://www.uvic.ca/finnerty/) (along with two dawn redwoods nearby!), as well as two more coastal redwoods in the front and back yard of a house at Carey and Glanford.

I've been unsure of how to vote, and have been asking different folks I know irl what they think of the top 3 candidates in the Victoria mayoral race.  A lot of people I talk to don't really have too much info on the candidates. Most of what I've heard from others can be summed up as: Helps wants us all to know she likes bikes, tents and low speed limits, Hammond is a right wing nutjob with no platform and Geoghegan is a business friendly centrist who wants more infrastructure and housing. 

I though I would ask the Redditers of Victoria their thoughts on the Victoria municipal election to help me choose how to vote and perhaps create a bit of a dialogue, as I haven't heard much about the elections lately. What say you Victoria?

VictoriaBC,NoBunnIntended,"Higher prices on the menu as restaurants open their doors As restaurants across the capital reopen to reduced seating and higher costs for food and pandemic safety, some diners will have to brace for higher bills — either immediately or in the near future.
Ian Tostenson, chief executive of the B.C. Restaurant and Food Association, said Tuesday that thousands of restaurants across the provinces are wrestling with startup costs while being able to use just half their seats. He said some will choose to raise the prices or add gratuities or other fees to ease financial pressures.

“I think everyone is evaluating; there’s no question it’s expensive to restart,” said Tostenson. “They will have to work out what their margins are with higher costs and at 50 per cent capacity. In order to keep the doors open they have to offset costs. They’ve also been paying rent with no income.”
Cliff Leir, who operates Fol Epi organic bakery at Dockside Green and Agrius Restaurant downtown, has increased prices by about 25 per cent and is eliminating tipping. He said the decision was made to better support staff and local suppliers.
“Producing food with great ingredients and paying our staff appropriately comes at a cost,” Leir said. “We believe that we have to support and invest in our local food economy if we want to keep it alive and healthy.
“We feel that it is our duty in this time of crisis to to purchase from our neighbours and local businesses as this is what will contribute to the betterment of our local economy.”
Shelly Gudgeon, owner of Il Terrazzo Ristorante downtown, is preparing for a soft opening today and is taking reservations for Thursday.
She said the restaurant had to eliminate its lunch service and seating capacity will be reduced by half. The upside, she said, is there won’t be any immediate price increases and they’ve added a new 14-seat patio on the Waddington Alley entrance. “We hope to rebuild our business one customer at a time.”
She said expenses are rising, and “three or four months from now, we could see modest increases [to customers]. But we’re hoping customers will have a dessert, or a more expensive bottle of wine, or bring their neighbour for dinner. We want to make up [for our increased costs] that way.”
At Brown’s Social House and Bar downtown, assistant manager Cody Miller said no extra charges or fees are being added to bills. He said the restaurant, which usually seats 130 inside and 30 on the patio, is operating at half capacity, with about 25 staff. “We’re just happy to have our guests back at this point, so we are not charging anything extra.”
The Local on Wharf Street has added an 18 per cent gratuity to bills since opening last week.
“There’s no rule book here,” said Tostenson. “A lot of restaurants are just trying to figure things out at this point.”
He has a lot of faith in diners who have been staying home during the lockdown and will start to visit restaurants again. “The public is generous in moments like this,” said Tostenson. “I think they like to support local restaurants and will help to take care of them.”
Meanwhile, many other service-based industries have been adding fees to their bills.
Several salons and barbers told the Times Colonist last week customers can expect to see extras on their bills for costs of sanitizing and other pandemic safety measures.
Customers at Hatz Hair Studio in North Vancouver will see a $5 charge to help offset costs associated with operating during the pandemic.
The hair salon is among retailers adding a COVID-19 surcharge, which can range from a few dollars to a percentage of the final bill.
Zazou Salon & Academy in North Vancouver charges $7.55. It calculated its charge by accounting for the revenue it expects to lose by reducing its capacity from 19 chairs to nine, as well as reopening costs such as team training and signage.
The salon preferred to be transparent with customers via the surcharge, rather than hide the added cost of business within a broad price increase, said Janine Cannon, concierge and marketing manager at Zazou.
“We see it as something that’s a temporary thing,” she said.

I confirm in disbelief: ""you mean, my kid might no longer be welcome at the practice he's been a patient at since he was born ... because he hasn't been sick in a couple years?""

Me:  😐😑😶🫥😶‍🌫️

I mean can we be serious right now?  Imagine how much worse our GP crisis would be if every patient of record was booking pointless visits every 6 - 8 months just to stay active in the system.

But christ on a cracker, my other 2 sons, his dad, me.... we've all visited a bunch of times over the last year.  Ytf would you drop one kid in a family??

Is this a safe part? There are a couple of low-income complexes nearby, and some of these folks were out and about as I was checking out the neighbourhood. I just haven’t lived around these buildings before and don’t know if it would be something to be concerned about (noise/safety/disruption)?

After searching this subreddit I’ve found that most answers to similar questions are “sell you car, get a bike” or “you can afford to live downtown so you can afford to pay for a parking spot.” Both of those answers are quite reasonable but I rely on my car for work and  before I start dishing out $200+ a month on parking I’m curious how realistic is it to live downtown without paying for a parking spot. I work 7:30am-4:00pm and after work spend my time running errands and taking the dog for an outing.

VictoriaBC,NormalButts,"Question for Carpenters of Vic So I’m a 2nd year carpentry apprentice In Victoria. I’m trying to figure out if my experience is similar to others in the field. So I’ve worked for a couple companies in town little bit of commercial, but mostly residential renovations. I’ve found that I’m not really learning much and a lot of the work I do is more so in the labourer category rather than carpentry and a lot of my fellow apprentices at my company feel the same. A lot of “move this, dig that, floor protection and cleaning up site”. I know these are all part of the job but 2 year into my apprenticeship I feel quite behind my peers at school and would not feel confident taking my level 3 any time soon or taking on any side work by myself. My wage is pretty decent but it’s really starting to feel like I’m not really getting anything out of the job I’m putting my 40 hours a week into. Another part of this is that I do really like the company I work for, feel very supported and looked after in-terms of safety and compensation/benefits and am hesitant to leave and not be able to find something similar. I worry leaving would be a grass isn’t greener situation.

VictoriaBC,Notoriouslydishonest,"My rental agreement ends this winter. I want to renew. How to approach? So, I moved to Victoria last winter, and managed to get a very comfortable apartment in a fantastic location for a surprisingly reasonable rate.  It was a different market then, I guess- they had actually just reduced the asking due to lack of interest.

From what I gather, things have changed significantly since then.  I've seen/heard a lot lately about bidding wars and outrageous rents for terrible places, and I kept thinking ""glad I got mine when I did.""  Until today, when I checked my rental agreement, and found that I (a known idiot) agreed to vacate at the end of my year.

I've still got four months left, but now I'm feeling nervous and a little sweaty.  I *really* don't want to go through the moving process again and I love my place.  Thing is, I have no doubt that they could replace me with a much more lucrative tenant, and they have no reason not to do that ASAP.  

I'm very tempted to shoot my property management company an email inquiring about renewing, but I'm new to both this process and to BC tenancy law and I don't want to blow my chance/mark myself as a sucker.

My main questions are:

1. Are there any limitations on the rent increase if my rental agreement is for a fixed term? (one of my fears is that they'll be capped at a small increase for me, so they'll evict me to sign a new and better deal)

2. I was planning on emailing something along the lines of ""I'm really enjoying the place and want to make some plans for next year, so I'd like to get an early start on the renewal process"" and let them make the next move.  Good idea?

3. I've heard that the influx of students is pushing the rental market.  I don't need to be out until December- am I putting myself at a disadvantage by trying to cut a deal during the summer rush?

4. How exactly does renewing a fixed term lease typically go down?  Do I say I'm interested, they name a new price and I say yes or no?  Should I expect to negotiate, or have to make an outrageous offer to keep the place?

That was when I was in my early 20s.  I'm 31 now and I have a couple of young kids.  Not only is that sport really expensive and time consuming to play, it's also really intense.  There's not much casual about it; I mean, there are the BC Supernaturals and Central Island Paintball up in Nanaimo, and those guys are awesome and pretty chill, but, they are still more serious than I was hoping for.  

Anyways, my kid got a Nerf blaster for his birthday from his Aunt.  He's 3 so he's still way too young for it, but we were trying it out and playing with it, and I had way more fun with it than him! 

I got to thinking, why couldn't I just use Nerf blasters and play in that speedball style format - that would be really fun right?  Well, looks like there's plenty of clubs in the States that play, and there are large format games known as Humans vs. Zombies (HVZ, https://humansvszombies.org/) which looks really fun.  But there are no clubs in Victoria for people who never really grew up to go blast each other in the park for shits n' gigs...... BUT THERE COULD BE!

So, at this point I own 16 Nerf blasters and 1000 darts.  I figured, I would get some pals together and shoot em' up, see if that was fun.  Yup ... it was, ""I should do this all the time"" I thought.  What an awesome way to get you and the kids running around doing something out of the ordinary right?  Can even bring the wife and bounce some foam off her - smart and fun.  

I've actually already lined up buying an airball field from the mainland.  That one is going to be a little pricey though, so I figured I see if there was some interest first.

As you may know, Victoria was deprived of its last adult entertainment establishment (strip club) in 2019, leaving a significant gap in the market. Since then, there seems to be a growing demand for such a venue, with many people looking for a place to unwind and enjoy some adult entertainment.

Our establishment will also prioritize the safety and well-being of our performers, with strict rules in place to ensure their comfort and consent.

However, we want to hear from the community and ensure that there is widespread support for this type of business. We believe that our establishment can bring economic benefits to the area, creating job opportunities and contributing to the local economy.

I’ve tried reconnecting every cord and no luck. I know absolutely nothing about computers, and don’t know what to troubleshoot.

Can anyone recommend either a shop or even better, has someone that could do it as a side job?

I've actually had dental problems for a few years now, but I've been too poor/scared to do it; my main problem other than the occasional pain is that two of my wisdom teeth are screwed up - one is sideways with cavities, and the other is literally falling apart (as in a 2mm piece of it fell out when I was eating last August). They don't hurt anymore and I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing.

 I'll be working in the shipyard area in Esquimalt, and ideally would like to live close to work and wherever I find myself spending my free time.

VictoriaBC,PMMeYourIsitts,"Royal B.C. Museum Responds to Accusations of Racism By Marsha Lederman. [Published September 12, 2020 in The Global and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/article-royal-bc-museum-responds-to-accusations-of-racism/).  


The Royal British Columbia Museum and Archives has hired a third-party investigator and brought in a diversity inclusion consultant after a prominent Indigenous staff member resigned, citing racism and a toxic workplace.

Lucy Bell, who was head of the First Nations Department and Repatriation Program, stepped down in July. In a farewell speech to her colleagues that month, she called for a zero-tolerance policy for racism at the Victoria-based museum, and called out staff and executives, citing examples of racist behaviour she has received and witnessed.

“There is outright discrimination. There’s white privilege. There’s bullying. There’s micro-aggressions that happen here every day. I have felt it a lot from executive, I have felt it a lot from my colleagues,” said Ms. Bell, who is Haida. The Globe and Mail has obtained a recording of the speech.

Ms. Bell said the last straw occurred during an anti-racism Zoom session, convened earlier this year as cultural institutions came under scrutiny for issues related to race. Bell said in her speech that she heard “racist” and “horrible” remarks during that session. In a subsequent interview, she told The Globe those remarks included an anecdote about alcohol use and Indigenous people, with one colleague saying, “It’s proven science that Natives can’t tolerate alcohol.”

She said during the speech that she also heard colleagues question the need to think about diversity or consult with First Nations communities when they were “so busy,” and that hiring Indigenous people constituted reverse racism. She said one co-worker told her: “I understand what you’re going through – I’ve been discriminated against for the colour of my hair for all my life.”

In another incident, after the Haida repatriation committee asked for two items from the RBCM collection, Ms. Bell said a museum staffer remarked: “The Haida cannot pick and choose artifacts for repatriation. They cannot treat this museum like a grocery store.”

Board chair Daniel Muzyka, who watched a livestream of Ms. Bell’s speech from his home, says he was disappointed and saddened by what she said and that it was the first he had heard of the allegations. He says he mobilized the board immediately. The speech was on a Friday; plans were in the works by Monday.

“We’re committed to getting action,” Dr. Muzyka says.

The alarming allegations and resignation come at a time of reckoning at cultural institutions in Canada and beyond, as the Black Lives Matter movement has helped spur calls for change and highlighted issues that BIPOC staff, visitors and would-be staff have had to deal with. High-level departures have followed allegations of racism at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights and of a toxic workplace at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. In the U.S., there have been claims of racism at institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts – run by former Art Gallery of Ontario director Matthew Teitelbaum.

Sharanjit Kaur Sandhra, a council member of the B.C. Museums Association who is doing her PhD examining critical race theory and museums, says she has found racism to be deeply entrenched within the museum sector. “Leaders in these institutes need to take ownership of their culpability in these toxic work spaces,” says Ms. Sandhra. “They have to own their complicity in it. You have to start from that place, because if the leadership won’t own it, nobody beneath them will.”

As a founding member of the Haida Heritage and Repatriation Society, Ms. Bell has co-ordinated the return of the remains of more than 500 Haida from museums in the U.K. and across North America, including from the RBCM. She joined the museum in 2017 as the inaugural head of the First Nations Department and Repatriation Program.

Among her early objectives was to change the way the ancestors were cared for at the museum – removing the bubble wrap and staples, rewrapping them in culturally appropriate fabric, and holding a ceremony with prayers.

In her goodbye speech, Ms. Bell told co-workers she was leaving for her personal well-being and cultural safety. “I’ve found that since I put in my resignation, there’s been a lot of finger-pointing – who caused this? You can’t point at one person. My friends, my colleagues, I want you to hear and feel my anger, my hurt, my shame, my frustration. I don’t want you to e-mail me later and explain yourself. I don’t want you to do further research to prove your points. What I want you to do is to accept your white privilege and do something about it. So that no other Black, Indigenous or person of colour has to go through this,” said Ms. Bell.

“Royal B.C. Museum, you have a long way to go to become anti-racist and to be a welcoming place for people of colour. I worry about our Indigenous communities coming here, I really do,” she continued. “I’m begging you to make some changes here. Mobilize your privilege and do something now. Be an anti-racist. Commit the time and the money and make really brave decisions, Jack.”

Jack is Jack Lohman, the museum’s chief executive officer. Mr. Lohman has been with the museum since 2012. Prior to that, he was director of the Museum of London, in the U.K.. He is also president of the Canadian Museums Association.

Mr. Lohman didn’t respond to an e-mail from The Globe on Thursday.

“I hope and pray that everyone here can commit to fixing this issue,” Ms. Bell said in her speech.

Dr. Muzyka told The Globe the organization wouldn’t wait until the results of the third-party investigation to begin implementing the diversity and inclusion programming. He said an evaluation and education process was beginning this month. The consultant will work with “the whole team, from top to bottom.""

The investigation is also underway. “There’s no limitation about who’s going to be interviewed,” says Dr. Muzyka. The investigator will follow the trail where it leads. “No one is outside of the investigation.”

Ms. Bell confirmed the remarks she made on the videotaped speech to The Globe and said she has since heard from some of her former colleagues. One asked her if perhaps this was her purpose at the museum: “to help them change, to help my colleagues have a stronger voice. And maybe it is. Not quite what I expected or wanted for my life,” Ms. Bell said in the interview.

She added she is hopeful for a positive outcome. “I think my colleagues know about me that I am always optimistic. I went to this museum because I saw the potential for change and growth; I still feel like that’s there. I hope they’re on the right path and are taking it seriously, and willing to make the changes so that my departure isn’t going to be in vain.”

As for Ms. Sandhra, she is a proponent of what she calls “naming and shaming” the museums and the perpetrators. “If you’re going to continue to silence, it’s not going to work,"" she says. “Leaders need to say that those who have contributed to racist work spaces will be held accountable, and they need to feel a little bit of fear.”

She adds this is a universal problem, in no way limited to the RBCM. But she says she has heard allegations of racism from more than one employee of that institution since delivering a provocative webinar to the B.C. Museums Association earlier this year.

“I don’t care if you’re uncomfortable,” she said to those watching the live-streamed event. “Because for centuries, Indigenous, Black, people of colour have been in discomfort from the very spaces you work in, from the very spaces that you curate in and design exhibits in and collect artifacts in. We have been uncomfortable for centuries. So one hour of discomfort will do nothing to you. The real indication will be what you do with that discomfort going forward.”","Alcoholic , Point in Time",0,False,8.333333333333332

VictoriaBC,PapoochCZ,"How much am I expected to tip in a restaurant? I'm new in Canada, and I am vaguely aware form online sources that the tipping culture is getting out of hand across the US. So I'd like to ask where exactly BC stands, generally.

I tipped 10% the other day in Vancouver - I mean I had to type in the amount in the payment terminal manually, because the suggested options started at 18%, which I found excessive given the already high price of the menu. However, the waitress seemed offended and went out on a little rant that such tip is ""not okay"" and that the average around here is 20 for an ""okay"" service. Anything lower means she did a shitty job (I mean I always thought that shitty job = no tip, but okay).

Now, where I come from, eating out is relatively affordable and tipping 10% is normal and doesn't hurt at all. But here it seems it's reserved for special occasions only. So please enlighten me a bit on this topic.

EDIT: Thank you all for the insights! So here is what I learned:

Servers need to _tip out_ the rest of the staff not by percentage of the total tip itself (which I assumed was the case), _but by percentage of the entire order_ (about 4-9%). So on a $50 order, they _owe_ the restaurant staff ~$4 that they're expected to cover with tips. That makes it possible for them to be paid _less_ than their hourly wage if they get less than X% in tips at the end of the day. This seems totally wild to me and I have no idea how that's legal, but I digress... So in the end it is basically the same as if all the prices were X% higher by default and the servers were paid like normal people, only sprinkled with an extra pinch of social pressure.

I now understand why the server was upset (obviously she knew I was a foreigner not familiar with this concept) and I'll be tipping accordingly from now on.",Affordable,1,False,0.0

VictoriaBC,PassportBC,"Tips from the passport wait line Thought i'd give out some info based on my 5 hours of waiting for a passport...

1- Always keep a copy of your passport information somewhere safe.

2-  Passport expired? If your passport was issued as an adult passport and  you have the old passport (or the passport information) you can use a  renewal application for up to 15 years after the expiry date if you are  not wanting to make any changes to the passport (name change, sex  change, etc).  if you don't have the physical passport you will also  need to submit a lost or stolen declaration.

3-  The Victoria BC passport office is only accepting walk-ins for people  who are travelling in the next 5 business days with a valid proof of  international travel. I guess this can change at any time but as of  today that's what was happening. Know what other offices are doing? Post  it in the comments.

4- If you  don't already have a valid passport, and unless you are travelling for  urgent reasons (bereavement, sick family members, etc) you better not  book overseas travel. Lots of people (me included) are not getting their  passport in time for travel and more often then none, only find out  passed the deadline to get reimbursed.

5- You don't need a passport to travel within Canada just a valid government issued ID.

6- Even if you pay all the urgent expedited etc fees, there's no guarantees that your passport will be ready on time.

7-  The best way to renew a  passport right now is still by mail when you  are not planning to travel in the next 6 months. Otherwise you need to  wait for 5 days before the flight submit in person and still risk not  getting it in time.

8- Lots of  people are not reading the info on the website properly, it clearly  states: ""Walk-in services are available depending on when you need the  passport. However, making an appointment is still recommended. If the  location is busy: you may need to wait **or**  they may ask you to come back another day."" It's insanely busy and the  system isn't even able to keep up with those that are urgently (less  then 5 days for Victoria) needing a passport. Save yourself a lot of  grief and waiting for nothing as you will be turned back from the  Victoria office if you are not travelling in the next 5 five days. It  looks like the only exception to this is for people that have travelled  from very far (as in remote regions far) and are travelling in less then  25 days but even for them there's no guarantees.

9- Proof of international travel is mandatory for walk-ins, says so everywhere on the websites.

10-  People are going nuts, this guy in the line behind me booked himself a  flight to the US in 5 days just so they would accept his application for  travel a month later to Europe....

11-  As long as your return to Canada is done before the expiry of your  passport you can still travel with it and don't need a new one for that  week-end get away your planning.

12-  Overheard the guards say that they had about 25-30 walkin spots for  victoria BC office each day and about 100-150 people waiting, guess if  you didn't line up early enough your probably not getting in.

13-  Lot's of people waiting just to check on the status of their passports  only to be told to keep calling the 1-800 number for passport and ask  for the file to be transferred to their local passport office unless  they are travelling in the next five days, in which case they can stay  in line but chances are slim to none that the transfer will happen in  time. I tried calling there, it's just like when you tried calling the  radio station to be the 12th caller through to win those hockey tickets  except you have to keep calling for days if not weeks. Don't despair  it's still your best bet and beats waiting since 6 AM in a line to be  told at noon to keep calling that number...

14-  Lesson learned : Always renew the passport during the year before the  expiry when I have no plans to travel instead of waiting at the last  minute when I have booked travel.

So  now down, 210$ after paying all the fees + lost all the money for my  flight and holidays to Cancun that left 1 hour ago... Guess I'll check  back next week if the passport is done.",Community Plan to End Homelessness ,0,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,PatBayandtheMalahats,"TD Bank Closing their Vic West location I got a letter in the mail the other day saying that my main branch (TD in Westside Village) was ""moving"" to their pre-existing downtown location. What the what?

If you live in Vic West or Esquimalt and bank with TD. Pretty soon your nearest branch will either be at Fort and Douglas in downtown Vic. Or at Tillicum and Burnside in Saanich. Meanwhile if you live in Oak Bay you can bank at Fort and Foul or drive 2 minutes to their Oak Bay Ave location. This closure makes no sense, and leaves a whole municipality void of services.

VictoriaBC,PcPaulii2,"A different take on rampant development in the CRD  I guess I would fall more on the side of the NIMBYs than the ""builders"" when it comes to unchecked development, but my rationale for opposing it has little to do with how big a shadow the building beside is going to cast.  Instead it has to do with the enormous elephant in the room that neither side seems to be taking all that seriously- infrastructure.

We live on an island. We have limited water and limited access to power. We have just finished a major sewer upgrade that utterly failed to take unchecked growth into account during its own planning stages and is already far closer to capacity than anyone thought it would be at this point and likely will not make it to the promised 30 year mark without yet another large (read: VERY expensive) upgrade.

So when we add another 100,000 people to the 440,000 we have already, will the services we all expect to be there be able to keep up? Frankly, I doubt it. Munis in the CRD have a sorry history of ""deferred maintenance"", which boils down to a policy of upgrading services only after something bad happens, not beforehand. Parts of the city still are working with the original wooden water mains and storm runoff pipes laid in the time of horse and buggy! How much more can those fixtures take before a real crisis hits? the CRD should have had a plan in place decades ago to systematically upgrade the whole shebang, but rivalries, inter-municipal friction and the ""need"" to put other projects first (bike lanes, anyone?) pushed infrastructure upgrades lower on the priority list.

Finally (sighs from the peanut gallery)- transportation, or as some call it the ""war"" on cars. What do we do with another 5-digit increase in the population? Apparently, we tell them ""Welcome, but don't bring your car here"".

We're putting the cart before the horse in almost every muni in the CRD. All councils have been swayed by small groups (As low as 15% of the electorate) that cars are bad, but no one has had the moxy to insist that before we kick the cars out (metaphorically speaking), we must first update and improve alternate ways of getting around, be it buses, trains or ferries... 

Transit is sorely in need of a serious upgrade to make it attractive, and making it attractive is far and away the best way to gain new riders (and get them out of their cars). Simply put, traveling by transit should not take three to four times longer than by car (and it does in many cases), it simply isn't attractive to uncertain riders. As a result, they stay in their cars. Yes, some take up cycling, but the real percentages are still well under a quarter of the commuters and likely to stay that way, no matter how much taxpayer money is spent on barrier-protected lanes and ""valet services"". Build a rational, usable transportation alternative and people will use it. Forcing them into a system that does not meet their needs only builds resentment and resistance.

VictoriaBC,Pendergirl4,"Saanich Police: 1 Person Running Red Light: 0 (Road Safety Discussion re Tillicum Road) TLDR: Police caught someone running the red light at the intersection of Tillicum and Regina today. Further discussion on the safety issues with that section of Tillicum Road in general and potential ways to improve safety and reduce the number of collisions/near collisions.

&#x200B;

Site: Pedestrian/bicycle controlled intersection at the corner of Tillicum Road and Regina Ave (sorry, no pictures or video)

Earlier this afternoon, for the first time in my nearly 13 years of living near this intersection, I witnessed someone being chased down by the police for running the red light.

Almost every time I cross at that intersection, someone runs the red light or enters the intersection when the light was clearly yellow as they approached. Some of the people are completely unaware that a light actually exists (those are usually the people who get partway through and then suddenly look a bit panicked). At this point, as a pedestrian, I basically treat it the same way that I do at a crosswalk without a traffic light - I wait to make sure that the cars are actually slowing down before I start to cross. Not always easy, as discussed later.

Today I walked up to the intersection as the light was changing to red. There was a group of three adults and six pre-school/kindergarten aged children (likely from the VNFC) who had already triggered the change. I wasn't really paying attention until I was about to cross (the group had already started) and heard a roaring engine. An unmarked police F150 came out of nowhere and barrelled through the intersection while turning lights and sirens on. The adults confirmed the person they were chasing had run the red. I'm pretty sure the police really just happened to be in the right place at the right time, directly behind the person who ran the light.

My excitement of seeing someone finally face a consequence for running that light is high, however that section of Tillicum Road is very dangerous for multiple reasons and really needs to have more enforcement and/or a redesign. The primary reasons are:

1. *The light at Tillicum and the Highway takes a long time to cycle.* I timed it once, crossing from the professional building to the diagonal corner at around 11am on a weekday. I didn't track seconds, but it was five minutes later when I got to the diagonal other side (this is the slowest way to cross, as you have to wait for the advance left to clear as well). People really want to make the light (heading up the hill) or not stop again (heading down the hill).
2. Following point 1, *drivers heading up the hill are fixated on the colour of the light at the highway* to the exclusion of all else. If it is green, it is almost like they get complete tunnel-vision. It seems like people heading down the hill are maybe still zoned out from sitting at the light on the other side for so long (or are just really impatient/running late as they didn't factor red lights in to their trip length).
3. *That section of Tillicum is designed like a highway*, despite there being a park right next to it with many young children playing baseball and several ingress/egress points along it. Drivers treat it as such in terms of speed and awareness of their surroundings.
4. Following points 1, 2 and 3, *drivers often rapidly accelerate on the hill up to the highway in an attempt to make the green light*. This is obviously breaking the speed limit several times over (the signs have been posted for the 40km/h change), but less obviously creates a very dangerous situation for anyone crossing at the Regina intersection and any cars turning left on to Battleford (or, to a lesser extent, Regina). As a pedestrian I have a bit of an advantage as I can often hear the engines roaring as the acceleration begins, even if I can't really see the speed increasing, however drivers don't have that ability (given that everyone always seems to have their windows sealed shut with either the heat or the A/C on). I haven't seen many collisions at the Regina intersection, but there is probably an average of one every month or two (that I know of) at the Battleford intersection. A large part of the problem at Battleford is a lack of visibility due to having to cross the left turn lane (which always has cars in it) and not being able to see the straight lanes, but if the drivers in the straight lanes were consistently going the speed limit, the impacts would not be as bad and possibly avoided entirely (there was a crash a month or so ago where the cars hit each other so hard that one of the cars ended up facing the wrong way in the middle lane heading up the hill to the highway. Keeping in mind that the vehicle turning left was likely starting from a stop (or near stop), the person coming up the hill must have been going REALLY fast).

Excluding days where drivers are already really irritating me, I usually try to be as courteous as possible at that intersection. I don't use the crossing signal if there is already a clear break in traffic. I check the colour of the light at the highway and usually wait a bit if it has just turned green (particularly if it is rush hour and the advance left lane is already backed up to Burnside - at that time of day the signal is often long enough that people on the other side of the intersection can make it through if they aren't stopped).

Over the years I have thought about how many speeding tickets the police could hand out if they just hung out for an hour in an unmarked vehicle using radar (and watched that intersection). I really think that the primary reason that so many people break traffic laws in Victoria is that the chances of them getting caught are probably less than 1%. If that chance was even 5% I think (hope) driver behaviour would shift a bit.

I think the only long-term solution is to redesign the road, similar (but to a lesser degree) to what has been done on the section between Arena and Gorge Roads. I am no traffic engineer, but I would think that making the lanes a little bit narrower/adding some larger features of some sort right next to the road to make it appear narrower, realigning the lanes so that there is only one that goes straight across the highway (the quick merge on the other side can be funny to watch, if you don't think too much about the fact that those are *adults* racing to be ""first"" or to get ahead by one car), a short lane for right turns at the highway intersection, and a dedicated left turn lane going almost all the way back to Burnside. I'm not as sure about going the other way. Someone who lives on the other side of the intersection would have better perspective on that.

Thank you if you read the whole thing! While there are many dangerous roads in Saanich that are often discussed, I don't hear this one brought up very often. I am interested to hear other perspectives/ideas for improvement (I know the biking system is...weird (and inconvenient?), to say the least, on that section of Tillicum as well).",Point in Time,0,False,18.181818181818183

VictoriaBC,Pimbata,"TC: No help for Helps? Victoria mayor reflects on plan to hire chief of staff Fromt TC:

A frustrated Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps said she might abandon plans to hire a chief of staff after the majority of councillors, led by Ben Isitt, balked at paying $120,000 a year for the new position.

Isitt won support for providing a base salary of $80,000 plus pension and benefits for a total of about $96,000 for the new position in the mayor’s office, to be called head of strategy and operations.

“I don’t even know that it’s worth it to go and seek a senior person who’s going to work for $80,000,” Helps said.
The proposed position would last four years — to the end of Helps’s term.

Helps said she had no one in mind but is not looking to hire an assistant or someone she has to supervise.

She wants to hire someone “who has the capacity and the leadership ability to just do things.”

“I didn’t envision somebody who was going to get paid the same amount or less than many of our unionized supervisors to come and be the executive in the mayors’ office.,” Helps said. “It doesn’t make any sense. The salary makes no sense, so I’m just kind of happier to carry on with the status quo.”

Isitt and others argued $80,000 is a good salary, about 2.5 times more than what is considered the living wage for Victoria.
The salary is double the rate of pay for city councillors, Isitt said, adding there would be a disconnect if the assistant to the mayor were paid more than the mayor.

“I think we’ll find some fantastic applicants,” he said. “You look at people working in the legislative assembly, it’s an exciting opportunity.”

Coun. Laurel Collins said as a councillor she is logging about 56 hours a week and paid about $40,000 a year.

“I have a master’s [degree] and I’m five or six years into a PhD program. I think this kind of position has appeal and benefits beyond the salary. … We do need to be thinking that there is a huge differential between our lowest paid workers and our highest paid,” she said.
Collins, Sarah Potts and Sharmarke Dubow were elected to council under the aegis of Together Victoria, which they describe as “a grassroots organization” that is “dedicated to creating an affordable, inclusive and thriving city.”

Coun. Geoff Young said the whole idea of creating a new political position in the mayor’s office was “bizarre,” noting the proposed job description essentially mirrored the city manager’s job description.
“The idea that we’re setting up some kind of parallel political process within the bosom of the city to reflect — I don’t know — the agenda of the mayor as opposed to the agenda of the council? I don’t understand what is contemplated here,” Young said.
Councillors still had to ratify their decision Thursday night past press time.
Council last month approved Helps’s recommendation to create a new head of strategy position to work in the mayor’s office, but said the estimated $130,000 annual salary Helps proposed was too rich.

They referred the issue back to staff for analysis. Staff consulted with an external compensation consultant and reviewed similar positions in other municipalities and recommend paying between $120,000 and $125,000 in total salary and benefits.
Helps made headlines in 2015 after being elected to her first term when she announced she wouldn’t be hiring an executive assistant at a salary and benefit package of $98,774 a year.
The mayor’s executive assistant was a job created by Alan Lowe when he was mayor and continued by Dean Fortin when he was elected mayor.

Helps said in 2015 that she didn’t see the need for an executive assistant and that not hiring one would save the city $400,000 over the course of the term.

Helps, who received $104,000 in salary and filed expenses of $22,949 in 2017, recommended the new position pay $130,000 a year — which she called “an honest assessment of what it will take to get the kind of support that will help in my office.”

Helps recommended the position be filled by Jan. 7 on a four-year contract, terminating the day of the 2022 election, but council decided the position should be filled in January and reviewed as part of the 2021 budget process.

-Where the cheapest places to shop are

-Which areas are the worst or best to live in

-How to avoid apartment scams!! This is a big one!

-Advice on budgeting or money saving 

-Best way to make friends in Victoria

-Are you happy living here? Why or why not?

VictoriaBC,Porcelainz,"Owning a car in Victoria-- is it necessary? Yay or nay? Hello! I am moving here from a different province. My biggest dilemma has been deciding if I should bring my car with me or leave it in my province at a family member's house as a backup (I don't want to sell it because I love it, and knowing that I can still come back for it anytime gives me a sense of security). The reason why I'm debating is because I know it's very expensive to live here. My car needs about 1000$ in repairs before it can pass an  inspection. Add BC insurance on top of that, plus gas, and it seems that it might become more of a burden than anything. I've never used transit to get around before, but I am open to using transit once I'm in Victoria. I'm also open to biking short distances. For more context, I'll be moving with my cat and my partner. I'll be the only one working at a full-time 20$/h job. My partner won't be working (only studying) and will be financially contributing with a student line of credit and student loans. So, is having a car actually worth the extra expense in Victoria? Is it better to just bike, walk, and use transit? Do you wish you had a car if you don't have one? Any advice and input appreciated. Thank you!

VictoriaBC,Primary_Opal_6597,"Civil discussion please I’m curious what people here in Victoria think about this. Victoria is known for being very progressive, but this is a contradiction of values that seems irreconcilable. 

My stance is pretty simple: lgbtq identity is innate, whereas religion and culture is not. Hence why there are gay and trans people across time and cultures, but cultures and religions begin, evolve, and fizzle out. One is an individual identity that forms a group (lgbtq), and the other is a group identity that forms individuals. This means that when it comes to minority rights, the rights of lgbtq people do supersede that of religious and cultural minorities. 

That said, I am deeply troubled by the national post placing this opinion piece on its front page, and I needed to read from the horses mouth what is said. So I am posting the official statement of the MAC. This is the epaper link: http://epaper.nationalpost.com/article/281539410584323

It would really help if moderate and liberal Muslims spoke out against this, but I’m also aware some feel unsafe to do so. I also wonder how, if possible, the lgbtq community can effectively engage the MAC in fruitful dialogue. We can’t just have minorities trying to out victimize each other for the support of daddy, right?

TLDR: In short, the statement by Trudeau, “Let me make one thing very clear: Transphobia, homophobia, and biphobia have no place in this country. We strongly condemn this hate and its manifestations, and we stand united in support of 2SLGBTQI+ Canadians across the country — you are valid and you are valued.” has OFFICIALLY lost the support of the Muslim Association of Canada for the Liberal Party of Canada.

I work for a Victoria SEO company that's quite successful yet VERY centric on the US dollar and can't expend any extra resources for the foreseeable future.

Since I started here it's been a great experience where I have had an opportunity to demonstrate a variety of skills at the same time as I learned a great deal of advanced SEO, managed to get current with HTML5, and finally got serious with PHP, MySQL, and AJAX to build up a full web suite here that tackles time tracking, schedules, link validation, PR checking, and client reporting.

As the crunch within the company became obvious the need to downsize came up and, obviously, if you have people already outgrowing their roles, those people should *really* look at moving onward and upward vs. sitting around for who knows how long.

I might not be a master of many things but I honestly don't think I've ever hit a technical issue that wasn't solved one way or another. My best bragging point is that I know how to solve problems even when I don't have the answer.

Re: “Boomers gonna boomer,” comment, Oct. 6. I am a boomer and I have two millennial-aged children. It seems to me that it’s all about life choices.

In my generation, student loans hardly existed. I worked from the age of 12 to save for living expenses, tuition and books. With the help of my savings and working during three years of attending post-secondary education, I graduated with no student debt and a full-time job.

Recently, at a town-hall meeting, my wife and I listened to a young man with an electronic engineering degree talk about how he could not afford to rent anything other than a room in a house after being evicted for a renovation.

He was paying more than 50 per cent of his income to rent. We felt very badly for him and spoke with him after the meeting to see how we might be able to help him.

This individual really opened our eyes. He explained to us that life-work balance was important to him. He would only work three days a week, as he enjoyed hiking, camping and other outdoor activities. There was no need for us to continue the conversation.

I have two millennial children, who I have given no financial support to other than a roof over their heads until they were 19. Both pursued their own education, worked part-time during their elementary and high-school years, saved their earnings, worked during their post-secondary education and graduated with full-time jobs.

These two millennials now own their own homes and have children. They don’t have the perfect life/work balance, but they make life fun and enjoy what they are doing.

Keep this in mind when you look at or think about boomers — 95 per cent of them earned what they now have without subsidized daycare, forgivable student loans and subsidized housing.

I think we will look back 30 years from now and discover that 90 per cent of millennials will have coped with their situations just as the boomers did. They will make it work through their own resources and smart life/work choices. Richard C.

VictoriaBC,RareBeach,"Despite wall of worry, developer pushing ahead with family home - Times-Colonist, October 24 The developer whose workers jackhammered holes in a historic stone wall in Oak Bay says he is committed to building his family home on the site, even in the face of neighbourhood outrage.

“Some people have expressed discomfort with our opening up the driveways,” said Mike Miller, owner of Abstract Developments Inc. “We feel that is a minority, not the majority.”

“We have had quite a lot of support from some neighbours that have reached out to us,” Miller said.

Last week, Abstract workers surprised residents and municipal officials when they showed up at a Miller-owned property to widen driveway openings in a 122-yearold rock wall fronting the lot, which spans 1.7 acres between Prospect Place and York Place.

A small crowd gathered, police were called and municipal officials hurriedly applied a stopwork order. Abstract countered that the order was invalid and the jackhammering continued.

Three hours later, Oak Bay imposed a 60-day temporary protection order, which Abstract agreed to obey. By then, the jackhammering was done, taking out 13 per cent of the wall’s Prospect Place and York Place frontages.

Later, Abstract said it removed portons of the wall because it feared that an expected move by Oak Bay council to enact a new heritage bylaw would restrict its ability to get the building completed. That bylaw has not been enacted.

The wall once bordered the home of Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper, a member of Parliament, cabinet minister and son of Father of Confederation Sir Charles Tupper. It is listed on Oak Bay’s heritage registry, but is not legally protected.

The lot and its wall have been controversial since Miller purchased the property in June 2016. Back then, it was vacant and overgrown, with one disused building, that has since been relocated.

Miller said he wanted to build a home for his family, and create four lots on the property as possible home sites for his children. But neighbours opposed the plan.

Plans subsequently shifted to an eight-home subdivision that would preserve the wall. But though it had community input, that plan won support only among those living on the Prospect Place side, not on York Place. Also, the plan did not accommodate a home for the Miller family.

After that, Miller indicated he was bringing back the original plan for a single-family home, for which he has already received municipal approval.

But the latest move to jackhammer openings in the wall in the face of stop-work order, valid or not, has angered nearby residents and the municipality.

Angus Matthews, one of the three neighbours who helped come up with the eight-home subdivision plan, said he regards the jackhammer action as “petulant” and “impulsive,” and a blatant “abuse of public trust.”

“It was just ‘stick it in your eye, Oak Bay, and stick in your eye, neighbours,’ ” said Matthews.

Miller said he regrets that some people in Oak Bay are feeling betrayed or hurt.

But he insisted much of the anger directed at him or Abstract is misplaced. “We have kind of been branded as somebody who doesn’t care about heritage and that’s not at all the case,” he said. “If we didn’t value those walls, we would have knocked them down three years ago.”

Miller said he understands that Oak Bay is a community that is passionate about heritage.

VictoriaBC,RareBeach,"North Cowichan Mayor Al Siebring says in light of a potential $50-million lawsuit, he is asking the public and council to reconsider a decision to reject Vancouver Island Motorsport Circuit’s bid to expand from one track to two. TIMES-COLONIST, OCTOBER 29. 2019, FRONT PAGE &#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We’re going to vote on this again,” Siebring told members of the Duncan Rotary Club on Monday. “And I’m asking council for another public hearing … I’m hoping we can do it by the end of November.”

After a late-night sitting on Oct. 4, North Cowichan council voted 5-2 against a second phase of the track and facilities off Highway 18. The move followed two lengthy evening public hearings that went into the next morning. In the second, exchanges became so heated that the mayor called police in case backup was needed to maintain order.

The major public objection to the expansion was noise from the track, but in the end, it was First Nations rights that swung the majority of councillors, after council received a five-page letter from Cowichan Tribes Chief William Seymour that criticized the plan. Siebring and Coun. Tek Manhas were the only two who voted in favour of the expansion.

The mayor told Rotary members that he’s hitting the “reset” button because of a letter from track owners, the GAIN Group, threatening legal action that the mayor estimates could require a payout in the $50-million range.

If successful, a lawsuit could put the district on the hook for $30 million (after $20 million in insurance is subtracted) — about what the district collects in taxes annually, Siebring said.

The mayor said he can revisit the third reading for the comprehensive development zone application, under the Community Charter, in light of “new information” — the legal liability the municipality might face. However, council must agree to hold another public hearing. He notified councillors on Friday.

The mayor has also reached out to Seymour in hopes they can schedule a council-to-council meeting in advance of the public hearing.

The mayor told Rotary members he’d rather have a “mouth full of simultaneous root canals than hold another public hearing on a file that’s this contentious.”

But Siebring said that after a number of “sleepless nights,” he has concluded that the community was unaware of the legal risks associated with the vote.

When the track was voted on last month, the mayor saw the rezoning application and expansion as a chance to fix a zoning headache — “remove any uncertainty around the permitted uses on those lands” — and get a raft of amenities, concessions, noise mitigation and environmental remediation in return.

The application for Vancouver Island Motorsport Circuit included almost $5 million in amenities and mitigation measures.

The owners say the facility already brings $1.5 million into the local economy annually and pays $158,000 in municipal taxes each year.

The Cowichan Tribes said it wanted governmentto-government consultation, saying the land is spiritually and historically important. If that didn’t happen, the First Nation wanted an archeologist on site throughout the entire development, and the protection of elk habitat.

The company responded to the second request, offering environmental observers for all major work. It also offered to extend protection for fish and water habitat to include elk habitat, and to provide a parcel of agricultural land to the municipality for purchase to protect that land for elk, said Siebring.

However, council decided that the expansion would run counter to the district’s environmental priorities and Indigenous-relations goals. At issue was an application to put three parcels of land in North Cowichan — two industrial parcels and one recreational-use parcel — under one comprehensive development zone. It would give the company legal stability and allow for expansion of its vehicle test-track facility.

The Vancouver Island Motorsport Circuit, on 18.74 hectares, opened in June 2016.

At the time the first phase was developed, it was spread over two parcels of land, one zoned recreational and the other heavy industrial.

The track is a permitted use on recreational land, but on the parcel zoned for heavy industrial, it had to fit under the category of “product testing.” It’s why supporters call it a “test track” and detractors call it a “race track.”

Municipal staff at that time allowed it and the test track was built, although it’s a decision today’s municipal staff might not have made, the mayor said.

Early last year, the company asked for a development permit to authorize the second phase of its operation, creating a new five-kilometre paved circuit and an off-road circuit. (The request now includes amenities including a new clubhouse and buildings for storing and repairing motor vehicles.)

The expansion would be on 42.47 hectares just north of the existing 18.74-hectare site, most of which is under the same heavy-industrial zoning. Municipal staff instead suggested the company put the development permit application on hold and apply for a comprehensive rezoning to remove uncertainty around the land use.

It was only because the company was asking the municipality to rezone the property — lump all the parcels of land together under one development zone — that the request had to go to public hearing.

Vancouver Island Motorsport Circuit said the expansion was a $36-million-plus investment that would create about 200 construction jobs and nearly 30 full-time jobs.

At the time, the mayor pointed out there was nothing stopping the company from simply asking the municipality for a development permit to develop Phase 2 as it had Phase 1, under the same zoning, avoiding a public hearing.

Still, council rejected the application.

As a result, on Oct. 15, North Cowichan received a letter from the GAIN Group asking to reinstate the original development permit application for Phase 2, based on what’s been allowed on two of the land parcels in the first phase.

The letter says that Vancouver Island Motorsport Circuit spent $37 million to engineer and build the first phase, and suggests denying permission for Phase 2 would put the land use for the first phase in doubt and could ultimately force them to close the entire operation, said Siebring.

“They say that if the development permit for Phase 2 is not issued, they will be bringing legal proceedings against the municipality,” he said.

Mariah Wallener, a director with the Sahtlam Neighbourhood Association, which opposes the circuit expansion, said the municipality has it wrong, however. While the first track and facilities were approved because they were on heavy industrial and recreational lands, the second phase would only be on heavy industrial land. Thus, the first phase wouldn’t be affected if the second was rejected as a non-permitted use, she said.

“I just can’t believe that we’re going to have to possibly go through all of this all over again. It’s frustrating and disheartening,” said Wallener.",Community Plan to End Homelessness ,0,False,0.0

Unfortunately, in late 2012 I suffered a severe Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).

After researching a lot about alternative therapies such as Photobiomodulation, HBOT, Neurofeedback, tDCS and a bunch of others they all sound very helpful but out of my budget and MSP coverage unfortunately.

I believe these therapies could really help me and benefit me from doing them but I am asking for any advice or support.

To go a bit further into what happened, in 2012, I suffered life threatening injuries to my head and brain after a violent assault causing bodily harm. 

After the event took place, I started having serious bouts of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and quick compulsive aggressive behaviors. Followed by unwanted thoughts and daily migraines. 

In early 2022 I start researching and advocating for myself and my brain.

At the time of the event, I was very young and did not have any resources or support to help me as I was on my own.

Unfortunately, I do not have much financial resources at this time and would like to ask if anyone knows of any services in Victoria that offer a community pricing for patients with lower income?

To this day in 2023 the offender has still failed to pay me the amount and here is why:

I have reached out to Crown Counsel, and they have stated:

That the judge sometimes does not impose a reporting condition unless he thinks it is necessary.

In June of last year 2022 I also called the offenders probation officer about working with her to try to get my restitution amount, she told me she would call the Crown Counsel to find out more information.

Later that afternoon in 2022, the probation officer called me back. She stated that due to the new criminal record there is no reporting condition to a probation officer. Which means the offender does not need to check in with a probation officer to have someone to be accountable.

The Crown Council has come back and stated that they can not do anything because there is nothing to breach based on his probation order even though he is failing to pay it he is just living life accepting he has a criminal record and not wanting to pay the restitution of the probation order condition.

My partner and I recently visited Victoria and it shot up to the top of our list of potential places to move to (from within BC). Just had some questions about the logistics of living and working in Victoria - i.e. job flexibility and work life balance.

Like anywhere in BC right now, I know people are struggling to get by even on full time work - wiith cost of living going up, and wages not matching the living wage - but is it completely insane to think you could get by on 4 days a week?

The thing is, while we are drawn to the career prospects, milder weather, and general vibrancy of Victoria, we are pretty accustomed to the seasonality and flexibility of work in Revelstoke where I have lived for the last 4 years, that allows us to work as many days a week as we want, take time off whenever we please - even as much as a month at a time - allowing us to take longer trips to visit my family back in the UK. 

(Before you start thinking Revelstoke is cheap to live in, we are just very fortunate to have a very good rate split between the two of us. It's as screwed here as everywhere else desirable to live)

This post is just from my experience, but I do believe it may help educate people on the basics of a key issue that is rarely brought up in this debate, and something that infuriates me personally: **the lack of second and third stage housing in this city.**

 In reality, it is really hard for someone who has been chronically homeless, addicted, or both to rebuild their lives, but it *is* possible with compassion *and* accountability. Whether people love or hate our city's approach to our homeless community, everyone wants to know what a possible next step is. Easier said than done.

*Edit:* going forward when I say 'we' I mean our collective social institutions and government bodies not our individual citizens.

Next steps are recovery housing and services that are affordable (and when I say recovery I mean recovery from addiction *as well as* any associated traumas). When it comes to housing we need:

'Wet' buildings for people who just want to use drugs and only need the bare minimum to keep them safe (clean needles, and a roof. Plain Jane stuff).

'Dry' housing for people who actually want to kick the habit. Right now, probably 80% of housing for the homeless is 'wet'. And half of the 'dry' housing is really 'wet' because workers are either paid so little or worked so hard they don't care to enforce the rules. Anawim House (with a whopping 7 rooms) is one of the only good examples of second stage housing in the city, though there a few others. Anawim is a small not profit (in the true sense of the word) with only 7 rooms... That barely makes a dent in our homeless population.

Privatized rehab facilities are pretty much a scam and those that aren't cost thousands a month, far more than any homeless person can afford. 

The problem can be summarized as this: the city (and most north american cities) treat addiction using a misconstrued version of the harm reduction model. Our version seems to be to prioritize keeping addicts alive rather than pushing other services onto them. This is an okay method *if* the services are still there for any addicts who do want to kick the habit and *if* the services are easily accessible for when that addict actually does decide to make a lifestyle change. Unfortunately, here in VIC all we do is try our darndest to keep addicts alive and then pat ourselves on the back for being nice, I guess? Despite our kindness, we also throw our hands up when it comes to people who are severely mentally ill (that's another thing entirely).

As it is now, if an addict has an epiphany to try and get clean they go talk to a worker somewhere. That worker then recommends they go through detoxification and then perhaps into stabilization. Detox Victoria, usually the first step on the road to recovery, has only 21 beds. 

Let's say that addict gets out of detox or stabilization with roughly 14-50 days of sobriety. This is a great start! But then they go... where? Either into a wet building if they are lucky or back onto the street. Either way, this a pretty demoralizing environment in which to try and stay sober, let alone get counselling or find and keep a job etc. Inevitably they relapse and the cycle begins again.

Thus, we need more resources to help people rebuild their lives rather than just stay alive (but we need those too).

*Edit:* I've worked in the field for a solid number of years. I have literally had homeless people sob at my feet because they have fought desperately for a few months of sobriety, and are understandably terrified of leaving stabilization because they know it will be essentially impossible for them to keep up that positive momentum. Sometimes, it will be this persons ninth or tenth kick at the sober can. Of course, they can't just stay at stabilization forever either.

Most addicts are good people underneath their addiction. Even the worst addict has fleeting moments of humanity, and the real disservice our society does to them isn't that we get angry and wish they could be better, but that we make it so hard for them to get better. For smokers out there, imagine being homeless and trying to quit smoking while everybody around you is lighting up.

To put all this simply:

The active user gets given a clean needle, a coffee, and a sleeping mat.

 The person 30 days sober gets a coffee, a sleeping mat right next to the active user, and is told, 'good luck'.

VictoriaBC,RicVic,"CRD signs- Thetis Lake was the beginning... but ALL parks need proper signs.  This letter sent to CRD Chair Plant re the sign debacle at Thetis Lake. They need to extend the moratorium to ALL CRD parks.  New signs may be needed, but they need to be the right kind of sign, not merely a screen-print-on-metal abomination stuck on a cement pad!

Send your thoughts to Mr Plant.

Dear Mr Plant: 

 It was heartening to both hear the outcry and also to see your response response over the Thetis Lake sign debacle. However, putting a ""hold"" on the Thetis Lake project should only be the first step in a re-think of CRD sign policies in general when it comes to our wonderful parks.  
Parks should be welcoming visitors with signage that is appropriate to a park, and not simply a near-clone of the signs at the water department or the landfill. Consider the beautiful signs welcoming folks to our National Parks and to many Provincial Parks. Why does the CRD feel the need to save a few dollars through the use of signs more appropriate to McLaughlan Point or a parking lot when it comes to welcome visitors to our parks? As an example, the competing ""Welcome to Victoria, home of Canada's Pacific Fleet"" sign on the highway, just meters from the ""new"" entrance to Beaver Lake get noticed and admired by thousands of people every year, many of whom take pictures of it. How many of those people will be struck by the new, ""government institution"" sign 30 metres away announcing ""Beaver Lake""? Will the flock to it and take selfies alongside?  Somehow, I doubt it.  
And what about the other parks? Will Gowlland-Todd suffer the ignominious fate that has befallen Elk-Beaver Lake with signs that look more appropriate to those for the neighboring landfill simply because they are ""easier to maintain""? Likewise, Island View Beach, Horth Hill, the Rail Trail, Island View Beach and the Galloping Goose... are they among the many parks slated to have bland CRD ""Standardized"" signage?    
The outcry over Thetis Lake was only about one sign. While deserved, it truly should be about ALL CRD parks signage.   
As a life-long resident, I was aghast when some years ago the original, redwood sign at the entrance to Beaver Lake Park was reduced to a pale grey & blue ""corporate"" version of its former glory. Over time, I accepted it, but I never liked it. Now even that institutionally-tinted sign carving has been replaced by a flat, garishly-white institutional sign that may work at the waterworks office, but is in no way appropriate to a glorious regional park. The new sign is exactly what it appears to be- chosen by a committee for ease of maintenance without a thought to ambience.  
I have a rule- ""don't knock something down without also advancing a solution"", so here is mine. Instead of a decision made within the CRD bureaucracy (and on a personal note, I would love to meet the person who submitted this for approval to discuss the artistic merits of design), as this rede-""sign"" appears to have been, why not hold a contest among the High Schools in the CRD?  There are some crazy-good graphic designers in the local schools, a contest to come up with the best possible signage would be a challenge that would leave a lasting legacy for the winning team. It could easily have rules to ensure the CRD logo becomes part of the winning design, if that is really important. Use of natural wood (properly preserved and stained) could also easily form part of the guidelines. Why not go for that kind of public engagement instead of foisting a sub-quality design with very little artistic merit on the Region?  
Whoever is in charge of ""branding"" at the CRD needs to understand that not all signs are created equal. Many have merit that exceeds the need for ""corporate branding"". To quote yourself, sir: ""in this circumstance, I think it is worth a second look"".  Indeed- the entire parks signage police needs that second look!   
Please extend your ""second look""?

Wow, so much has changed since my last post. It's getting pretty serious out there. It is almost to the point where I might have to stop delivering. Luckily I have a full time (now work from home) job, but a lot of my delivery brothers and sisters NEED this income. If I could ask a huge favor from the people of Victoria...

Please meet your driver outside at the curb / parking lot. I know it's amazing to have the food brought right to your door, but we don't want to touch your buzzer, door handles, elevators, railings and whatever else we have to touch while delivering. We are already having to put ourselves at risk by going into multiple restaurants a night, but it is way more dangerous going into places where 5, 10, 100s of people live. We don't know what has been sanitized or not. 

I went through about 25 pairs of gloves today and a bunch of hand sanitizer, but as you know these items are hard to come by. Uber said they would send drivers these supplies, but they haven't yet. 

I had some amazing deliveries today where I got out of my car, placed the item on the driveway / step and got back into my car. Then the customer came out and got their order. Completely no contact! Perfect!! 

***Now I understand some of you may be in quarantine or even have the virus, if that is the case, I got you! I will come into your apartment building and leave it safely at your door. I am just wanting to limit the amount of apartment buildings / front porches I have to come in contact with. 

Thanks for all your kindness and for supporting myself, small businesses and our delivery services. If you have any questions, comment below, I would be happy to answer for you.","Point in Time, Safe Supply ",0,False,60.0
VictoriaBC,RobertTheThird84,"Hello from your Friendly Neighborhood Uber Eats Driver! Hey everyone, its been a while since I posted, but I have some things to share! 

First off I wanted to ask a huge favor from all of you. It does not matter if you order from UberEats, Skip,  Doordash or anyone else out there. Please RATE YOUR DRIVERS. The vast majority of drivers are amazing and do a wonderful job, but there are a few out there who are horrible! I have heard a lot of people complain that the driver marked the delivery as complete, but they never got their food. What is happening here folks, is some drivers are working two or more companies at the same time. We drivers see how much $$$ we are going to make before we accept the trip. Sometimes these ass hole drivers will be on their way to you with your order and all of a sudden get offered a big pay trip from another service. They only have one minute to accept before it gets offered to some one else, so they will lie and mark your order as dropped off and take the bigger money trip. This is horrible behavior, but nothing negative will happen to these bad drivers as its their word against yours. The only way to get these drivers off the road is to rate them poorly. I know with UberEats once you fall below 80% ranking your account gets suspended and you can't drive. On the flip side, your thumbs up ratings go a long way for us good drivers so keep em coming! About 20% of my customers take the time to rank me. (But happy to report I am at 99% Thumbs Up for the last two years).

I quick reminder, most restaurants seal the bags with your order and your driver has no way of making sure everything you ordered is there. It is rarely the drivers fault if something is missing from your order, so please don't rank us bad for that.

Next, just a friendly reminder to all of you, please select zero contact delivery. As much as I would love to see your smiling hungry faces, us drivers need to stay safe out there and that means coming into contact with as little people as possible.  Also if you live in an apartment, please please please come down and meet us at the front door. Apartments are very dangerous for the spread of COVID-19, and having a bunch of strangers entering the building that don't live there is not helping. If you are in self isolation and can't meet me downstairs, no worries! I'll bring it up and leave it at your door. 

Lastly I just wanted to say thank you to the people of greater Victoria. Over the last 5 months you have been so generous and accommodating in dealing with your drivers. So many of you have been tipping more, meeting us at the curb and making it easy for me to feel safe while delivering. Ya'll rock!

VictoriaBC,RobertTheThird84,"Tips from your delivery driver! Hey Victoria! 

Your Friendly Neighborhood Uber Eats driver here.

Since my last post I am happy to report not a single person has given me their apartment access code! Way to go Victoria :) I thought I would share some other tips that will ensure you get your food quicker and (a little selfishly) make my job a bit easier. So here we go! 

1. Directions. If you live in a giant complex or a complicated place like the UVIC campus. Please give clear directions. Example: if you give the main address to UVIC and all you give me is ""The Pheonix Building"" that's not really that helpful. Parking lot #s, landmarks, what it's close to... anything extra is a big help! 

2. Pick up your phone. If you have ordered food, and you get a call from a number you don't recognize, chances are it's your delivery driver needing to ask you something. I know it's 2019, but ya gotta pick up the phone. It's most likely me either trying to find you or the restaurant is out of something and they want to know what else you want. 

3. Where is your house #?. If your house does not have a visible street number, let me know in the delivery notes, it will be a huge help. You can also give me details like ""it's the grey house"" or ""the one with the red car in the driveway"". 

4. Lighting is key. Please turn your porch lights on. It gets so dark so quick right now and a little extra light goes a long way.

5. Pick the closest location. Now this tip is more for you guys then me. But when ordering from a fast food place or convince store, double check it is the location closest to your house. Tonight I delivered some Slurpee's from the hillside 7/11 all the way into James Bay. I passed three other 7/11 locations on the way. If you don't want melted Slurpee's or cold food, double check that location before you order.

6. The best thing you can do! Your delivery driver LOVES it when you meet them outside (or in the lobby). It saves us so much time and we all really appreciate it. 

7. Tipping. Yes we make tips and we love them. I try really hard to earn them by providing quick and friendly service and take extra care of your food. 

With Uber all tips go to your driver and are over and above what Uber pays us.

With DoorDash whatever you pre tip gets lumped in to the minimum delivery fare (so even though the driver does get the tip, doordash does not have to pay them as much for the delivery (so tip your door Dash driver cash if you can)

I can't speak to Skip The Dishes, as I don't drive for them. Maybe someone can comment how they work.

8. Missing Items. As much as I would love to double check your order to make sure everything is there, most restaurants staple the bag shut. So please don't blame your driver if something is missing. (Fully understanding it really sucks). All the apps have ways you can get a refund, or they will send another driver to get the missing item.

Well that's it! Hope this helps you all enjoy for meals a little more! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments.

Consider this a  PSA to get renters insurance especially if you live in one of the crappy old places that aren't taken care of by the landlord or homeowner. They have insurance for everything they own inside the house. But most renters have to take the any potential losses on their stuff and have to be left to their own devices which can really blow when our crews show up at 3 am to extract water and set up gear.

VictoriaBC,Rooshma,"Various Local Representatives' Views on Fare-Free Transit There seemed to be a lot of interest surrounding Ben Isitt’s proposal for a referendum on fare-free transit in Victoria. I thought some may be wondering what other public representatives think.

In September of last year, I sent the following email to as many mayors and councillors as I could find email addresses for.

“As you may know, as of September, public transit in B.C. will be free for riders 12 and under. Given what we know about the climate crisis, I support publicly-funded measures such as this to encourage more efficient transportation. I would like to know what you think.

1) Do you support the plan to make public transit free for youth 12 and under?

2) Would you support expanding this plan to include youth 17 and under?

3) Would you support expanding this plan to passengers of all ages?”

I’ve included their responses below, verbatim.

**Victoria**

*Marianne Alto*
>1. Yes
>2. Yes
>3. I’d need to consider the financial and service delivery capacity of local transit before making a decision on free transit for all, but I would certainly consider doing so based on evidence and capacity.

*Lisa Helps*
> Victoria has provided a UPass to people 18 and under for the last two years. So yes! And we are already doing it!
(I responded, asking if she would support expanding fare-free transit to everyone)
> In theory I do support this. But we’d need to have a different financing model to make it so. Right now Transit is funded in part by property taxes, in part by fare revenue, in part by gas taxes, and in part by Provincial funding. So I wouldn’t support shifting the cost for transit to local property tax payers as that would make life in the city even less affordable. So if there’s a way to modernize the funding model to support fare free transit for all, yes, I’m in support!

*Ben Isitt*
> I have consistently advocated for fare-free public transit for everyone, including in this 2019 report to Victoria City Council and the Victoria Regional Transit Commission. And “YES” to all three questions.

*Jeremy Loveday*

>The City of Victoria already provides fare free transit for youth. I am happy the Province is now stepping up. 
>Here’s a previous news story that may be of interest (https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.cheknews.ca/victoria-city-councillors-vote-for-free-public-transit-but-hard-sell-for-premier-555665/%3famp)
>I’m very much in support of free transit being made available to youth across the Region and Province, as a step towards efficient, low-carbon, fare-free public transportation for all.

**Saanich**

*Susan Brice*
>In response to your questions regarding fare free transit I offer the following response. I do this as a Saanich Councillor and in my capacity as Chair of the Victoria Regional Transit Commission. I can advise you that this topic has been discussed over the past several years at the Commission. We are proponents of providing more transit as a means of providing reliable transportation in an environmentally sustainable form.

>1. I totally support the Province’s decision to provide fare free transit for youth 12 and under. The government provided all the funding for this initiative to the Transit Commission.

>2.&3. While it would be ideal to be able to provide transit at no cost to the user, we are legislatively provided only 3 sources of funding to cover the local share( property tax, gas tax and fare box revenue)

>Without the funds provided through the fare box we would not be in a position to meet our goals of more transit coverage, increased frequency and transition to electrifying the fleet. Without the fare box revenue we would not be able to maintain current service and certainly not expand.

(Despite getting a very thorough response, I pressed her on 1) increasing property or gas taxes, 2) whether her position would change with provincial/federal support, and 3) how Victoria’s free passes worked given the three funding sources identified. She responded!)

>1. Increasing property tax would be an option but research has shown that the dollar investment in providing more frequent and reliable service is more of an incentive for the public choosing transit than the cost. 
>Gas tax rates are set by the province. It is currently 5.5cents a litre. A few years ago the province raised it from 3.5 cents a litre but that was only after many years of lobbying. A challenge we face is that this revenue source will diminish as more people transition to EV and do not purchase gas. 

>2. If the Fed and Prov gvts. Increased the operating grants then fare free transit would be a consideration. As I said previously we would want to make sure that increased transit investment was targeted to the area that would provide the highest probability of increased ridership. The Prov currently provides funding for operating and capital budgets and the Fed govt only funds capital. 
>We are in the process( first 10 arriving coming year) to transition to electric buses and this is also a high priority as we are committed to reducing GHGs and meeting our climate targets. 

>3. The Transit Commission through legislation can only use the funding levers previously stated. As well Transit can enter into bulk purchase arrangements from entities such as UVic and Camosun UPasses, or large employers Propasses. In those cases the entity purchasing the passes enters into an agreement. In the case of Victoria they indicated they were interested in such an arrangement for yourh passes.  Separately from Transit the City determined that they would pay for those youth passes with revenue they collect from parking. 


*Zac De Vries*
>In short I support the BC government’s funding of youth under 12 to have free transit. I would support the BC government making further efforts here. However the primary barrier to public transit is the reliability, frequency and area of service. I could not support more regional requisition without an expansion or increase in frequency of transit. Without changes to the quality of service we will not grow ridership. Under 12 is the best opportunity for free transit. 

*Fred Haynes*
>I am responding to your email as the Mayor of Saanich, member of the Victoria Regional Transit Committee, and member of the CRD Transit Committee.

>I have discussed this idea of free transit, in several forums.  I completely support free transit for youth 12 and under. I appreciate the youth 17 and under has appeal, but has some challenges.

>Without the funds provided through the fare box we would not be in a position to meet our goals of more transit coverage, increased frequency or transition to electrifying the fleet. Without the fare box revenue we would not be able to maintain current service and certainly not expand service.

>While it would be ideal to be able to provide transit at no cost to the user, we are legislatively provided only 3 sources of funding to cover the local share (property tax, gas tax, and fare box revenue).

*Rebecca Mersereau*
>Yes, yes, and given the gravity of climate change challenges, yes.

*Colin Plant*
>Yes
>Yes
>Over time if 1 and 2 are successful yes.


**Central Saanich**

*Zeb King*
>Thanks for sending this message re transit. I am totally supportive and always looking for people who will work together with me to push for more in this regard, as you may already know from Googling me and Transit. 


**North Saanich**

*Heather Gartshore*
>This isn’t an issue I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about;  my lens is the District of North Saanich which is not well served by BC Transit. 

>While I’m not opposed to providing transit free for 12 and under, I do wonder what the uptake will be in that age group for children travelling alone?  Maybe 10 and 11 year olds to school?  But they can probably also take a school bus.

>I would prefer to see programs like these tied to family income;  I know there are many children and youth who would benefit from such a program, but there are many who would not require a public subsidy — and we are heading into a time where the bills are going to come rolling in (from Covid) and they all need to be paid :) 

>In North Saanich, many folks accessing transit direct from home would be doing so walking on the side of the road or on a treed trail — not really inviting in the dark and rain.  Even less so for young people.

*Carl Jensen*
>Thanks for the questions. At this point, I could not offer a response on any of your questions without knowing how any of these scenarios would be funded. Until we could see what the increase for the local government contribution would be, it would be irresponsible to support the free transit initiatives knowing that nothing is truly “free”.

**Esquimalt**

*Barb Desjardins*
>This will add significant cost for us to support. I support the intention and goal but would like to here your solutions for how this will be funded 


**Langford**

*Lanny Seaton*
>Let’s reinstate the rail  
>We have a corridor that runs thought the island and it would be a better use of tax payer funds 
>It would also take more cars off the road 

**Colwood**

*Michael Baxter*
>I support the plan for free public transit for 12 and under and in addition I support the following items for public transport in this order.

>1.	Net zero public transport.
>2.	Bus Rapid Transit on TCH with coordinated feeder routes.
>3.	Increased frequency and comfort on all other routes. A doubling of service where it is less than five to fifteen minute headway’s during current rush hours would be a good start.
>4.	Free bus service 16 and under.
>5.	Compass type cards for all other residents preloaded with enough for a month’s commuting and including increasing discounts the more the card is used.

**Federal Parties**

*David Busch*
>The Conservatives support public transit and housing. From our platform:

>* To swiftly increase housing supply, we will implement a plan to build 1 million homes in the next three years.

>To do so, we will:

>* Leverage federal infrastructure investments to increase housing supply.

>We will:

>* Build public transit infrastructure that connects homes and jobs by bringing public transit to where people are buying homes; and

>* Require municipalities receiving federal funding for public transit to increase density near the funded transit;

>The plan you mention below was created by the BC Provincial Government and IS A MATTER OF PROVINCIAL JURISDICTION. Having said that, there may very well be benefits to expanding the the
program to include more riders. Costs and benefits would need to be explored. If I am elected I will work with the Provincial Government to see what can be done.

*Randall Garrison*
>An NDP government would work with municipalities and the provinces on creating modernized expanded public transit systems. For municipalities and provinces who identify fare free transit as a priority, we will work with them to build towards a fare free transit system that could ease commutes, help people make ends meet and lower emissions. The more accessible public transit is the more people will use it.

*Elizabeth May*
>The Green Party has long supported public transit without fares.  The answer to all three of your questions is “yes.”

>I do not see it in the platform this time, but it remains our policy.

>On transit, the platform focuses on expanding zero-carbon transit options in urban areas (which many parties talk about), and we are proposing a massive expansion of affordable ground transit in areas that were served by Greyhound, and similar companies across Canada.  We propose reimagining and legislating VIA Rail as a national passenger transportation network of rail and bus service. That would not be free, but would be within reach of all. That was a key recommendation from the Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.

*Tyson Riel Strandlund*
>As you’ll see in our platform, my Party supports major investments into public transit in order to expand coverage and increase efficiency and ridership. This includes the creation of a publicly owned and democratically controlled bus service powered by renewables which would provide free public transit to riders of all ages.

Got off the ferry and in the thick of it. Made it through the Sidney light without even having to slow down. By the time I passed Island View, I realized I hadn’t hit a light. Then came Sayward and my streak ended (I didn’t actually have to stop but the act of slowing down to 20-30km/h ended the perfection I had up to that point). I was sad my streak ended but it was such an amazing feeling. I knew Uptown would be where the streak would end and to think I was one light away was shocking. But life goes on. 

Then I got to Blanshard and made it past Vernon, Uptown, then Saanich. Went through Cloverdale and Tolmie. And then I had to wait for the left turn at Finlayson, which I count as the end of my journey. 

I got off the ferry at about 6:30 and was home by 6:45. Even looking at timing right now, it estimates 26 minutes and that’s at 10pm and not in ferry traffic.

VictoriaBC,SCRINDO,"Absurd rental costs (young person) So, I'm a 22 year old living and working in Victoria. For the two years I have been living here, I have paid over half of my full-time wage monthly while living with 4 other roommates, just for rent alone. All other bills utilities/water/ electricity + rent included, even divided by 5 people in the home we have rented, equals out to almost $1400 monthly. 

I don't work for minimum wage, I have a full time trades job, and I still have to feed myself.

So what's going on? Why do I have to sit back and watch rental costs blow sky high, while food and commodity prices inflate, and wages stay the same?

I'm growing exceptionally frustrated with the greediness of landlords. I can't even live here unless I have 3-4 other working roommates splitting rent. 

I had to be homeless for a few months last summer because of how absurd these costs were.

Anyways, hundreds of young people across the city are experiencing the same thing as me, and it's extremely stressful. 

Give me your thoughts.

EDIT: The oil prices for heating were mad because of the state of our insulation in this old home. I factored that into a mean monthly costs. We spent WAY too much on heating, and i understand that. We had weeks of 3 degrees celsius winter nights in our home anyways (literally not joking). Oil was skyrocketing at he time, not sure how it is now since we haven't needed it this summer. We probably fucked up, but a year ago, there was barely anything better. I get the idea of ""Well, if you cant afford to live near a city center, then don't.""

Anyone forget I have to pay for what I am learning?

Working full time as per union, of 33 hours a week at 27.50. Twelve hours shifts. One hour unpaid. Five years in Healthcare. Various roles working my way up, and attaining education along the way to increase my income.

~1200 ish per pay cheque. I have a pension, union, benefits to pay into and insurance. I make about 68% of my full pay after tax and said deductions.

VictoriaBC,SafeToRemoveCPU,"Man who yells very aggressively in Cook St Village. tl;dr Does anyone know about the shaved head guy who walks around Cook St Village/Southgate St, screaming and cussing loudly at the top of his lungs, sometimes in the middle of the night?


For the past several months, there has been a guy walking around Cook Street Village/Southgate Street, who seems to be arguing intensely with people or voices in his head. Usually it's loud yelling,, but sometimes, usually at night, he is SCREAMING as loud as he can, like he's trying to reach the back row of a large venue. It echoes throughout the street, so everyone can undoubtedly hear it (I just heard it from inside, with my earbuds in, playing music). He has a shaved head, usually black shirt, black pants, about 5'5"". Sometimes I see him walking during the day, multiple times around Southgate Street, pacing like he is going to fight someone, but sometimes he walks normally. Sometimes he is vaping something, but I've never smelled it so I don't know what it is. For his age I'd guess late 20s.


The themes of his rants seen to resolve around previous abuse that may have happened to him, people who tell him to off himself, and various people who have let him down or wronged him. One time it was people who took his ""ibuprofen"". He also throws in LOTS of cussing. F-bombs and ""ASSHOLES"".


Does anyone know him, what is likely going on with him, or had any interactions with him? A bit more context: He doesn't appear to be disheveled or obviously unhoused to me (I saw him walking with some Starbucks once), so I wonder if he has a home but goes outside to scream to avoid disturbing his housemates or family, but of course it's hard to be sure. I would like to be able to say hello to him, and at least get know name, so that I am not a stranger to him if I see him walking around, and maybe try to understand him a bit, if it's possible. Of course, I am hesitant to approach him or call out to him because of his very aggressive demeanor. For the first time today though, I saw a woman call out to him today, in the evening (which is pretty risky) asking if he was okay. She walked over to him, out of my view, and then he stopped yelling. So now I wonder if he can sort of ""snap out of it"" when someone actually talks to him.","Reaching Home , Unhoused ",0,False,0.0

More than 900 housing units started this year in Langford, triple the amount of the next closest municipality
AUGUST 10, 2018 05:20 AM

DB Services Victoria is so busy building rental projects in Langford that it turns away new projects every month, says the company’s director of development.

The Langford-based firm is one of the developers supporting the West Shore’s building boom, where rental apartments, condominiums and single-family houses are under construction.

In the first seven months of this year, 911 housing units were started in Langford, far outpacing other Greater Victoria municipalities. Saanich followed with a distant 284 housing-unit starts.

So far this year, 2,185 homes have been started in the capital region, up from 1,913 for the same seven months in 2017, according to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.’s latest report.

And every CMHC report shows strong construction in the West Shore, where the population is growing and where councils say they are committed to an efficient approval system.

“We have been turning away work for about two years here. We have five years worth of work lined up on the books right now. It’s all rental stock,” said Matthew McKay, partner with his mother Margaret McKay and with Gary Lahnsteiner, in DB Services.

DB Services is building three rental projects in Langford. It builds and owns about one-third of its projects, with the rest constructed for clients. The Arc, at 2849 Bryn Maur Rd., is being built for a client. The six-storey, wood-frame building will have 93 units. “We just poured our first footing there today,” McKay said Thursday.

The Arc is next to Hockley Corners, 765 Hockley Ave., which will have 63 units and be owned by DB Services. It is the first residential building on Vancouver Island to be built with cross-laminated timber, although some local institutional buildings have used that product, he said. It replaces a traditional floor system.

“We erected today pretty much our whole floor system,” at Hockley Corners, McKay said. That work would normally take five days and require more workers.

Prefabricated cross-laminated timber floor panels, supported on glue-laminated timber and parallel strand lumber columns, were used in the University of B.C.’s 18-storey Brock Commons student residence, which opened in 2016.

DB Services’ third under-construction project is the 11-storey, steel-and-concrete Danbrook One, which will have 90 units in the core of Langford.

The company only builds rental. That type of housing is in demand in the growing West Shore and financing is easier to obtain with rental developments, because it is not conditional on presales, as with condominiums, McKay said.

In June, the company finished the 63-unit Peatt Commons Phase One, at 2854 Peatt Rd. “Before we even turned it over to the client it was fully rented,” he said.

Despite the year-to-date climb in housing starts, the 417 starts in July was lower than the 695 in the same month last year, CMHC said.

Month-to-month housing starts numbers can vary significantly depending on timing of projects. Longer-term figures reveal a more accurate picture of the state of housing construction.

The number of Greater Victoria homes under construction — some projects can take two years to complete — stood at 4,731 as of July, CMHC said.

As well, the value of building permits, which signal builders’ plans, has climbed.

The value of building permits in the region was $160.4 million in June, up by 29.5 per cent from June 2017 when the value was $123.8 million, Statistics Canada said in its monthly report.

June of this year was up by 9.2 per cent from May, when permit values reached $146.9 million.

“It is definitely the residential market that is driving some of our bigger numbers with the permit data. It’s continuing to demonstrate that it is a strong market,” said Rory Kulmala, chief executive of the Vancouver Island Construction Association.

Greater Victoria’s low rental vacancy rate is one factor driving market demand for more housing, he said. “I think we are seeing that in a lot of communities on Vancouver Island.”

I own a business here in Victoria. I will be expanding into a much larger scale within the next couple weeks. I’ve found someone to take on the new branch of my company and run it for me, but I am in need of some advice. 

The technical business side of things is NOT my strong suit. Myself and the person who will be running the new side of my company, originally agreed to a 25% profit share once the profits start coming in. But over the past few weeks he’s ended up asking me if I might be more into a partnership than a profit share.

I’ve built my company from the ground up over the past years and it has a big demand and many vendors who are hounding me to carry my product. I’ve created the relationships with these vendors and my customers and my community. It’s hard for me to think of just handing over a part of all that I have built up. But at the same time, my new hire will be taking over and running 90% of the new side of my company. So I understand his want for more of a stake in the company to keep him motivated in the expansion across the island, BC and then Canada.

I don’t really know where to look in regards to resources on this kind of situation and was hoping there might just be someone here in Victoria with some knowledge or advice. Or perhaps specializes in helping smaller businesses expand. I would happily pay for the help! 

Would also love to hear anyone’s experiences if they have any, from personally expanding their own business.

I don't remember anyone's name even though I tried my best to repeat them when they introduced themselves (shock will do that) but if anyone knows the people who were in the casting room with me at Jubilee the night of the 21st, the ambulance drivers that picked me up, the surgeons or surgery daycare workers on the 23rd, please thank them for me or forward this post. 


The paramedics that arrived were very kind and kept me talking through the bumpy snowy ambulance ride. The nurses(?) and doc that set my foot back into my ankle and applied the cast (and the barrel of drugs it takes to sedate me), the x ray techs, the man who noticed how uncomfortable I was in the waiting room and offered to find me a chair to put my foot on, the porter that wheeled me around, the nurses in surgery daycare, and the surgeons that put surgical steel in there today ALL made it way easier for me to keep it together. 


They all showed a complete stranger so much kindness in an overworked understaffed industry during the holiday season AND basically undriveable conditions AND whatever flu is going around AND covid Burnout, etc. They kept me preoccupied so I wouldn't focus on how gross it was to have my foot flop and crunch around for an hour. They laughed at my probably terrible, incoherent drugged up jokes.


It was extremely traumatic (not exactly painful) to go through that as someone who suffers from a healthy mix of panic disorders, so it means so much to me that nobody was impatient or rude or assuming, just helpful and kind.


Lastly, be careful and stay safe everyone. I wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy.

\-Original Post sent to VIHA follows-

 Gotta say. I'm not impressed on how our local hospital in Comox is  handling this Covid19 issue. I have a family member who doesn't reside  with me. She just returned from a trip to New Orleans and she is showing all signs of the flu and also coughing and  trouble breathing. Calling 811 is a joke. You can't get through, we've  been re-dialing for hours. We popped in to our doctors office and they  told us they've been instructed to send people to the ER to get a swab  kit to take to the person with the potential infection. So we head over to ER and they tell us they don't give out swabs.   
  In fact, they really didn't know how to  handle it and said unless the family members symptoms became severe  and  they needed medical help, that they should not come into the hospital and that there  is no other way to get tested. Meanwhile my family member, as well as many others, are  self-quarantining themselves without even knowing or maybe ever knowing  if they actually have Covid19. Just ridiculous. What the powers that be are  telling people to do, just isn't working and I really fear that the  hospitals, especially here on the island, are nowhere near ready to  handle this issue. 

If people aren't being tested, how to we really known how many people have Covid19? I seriously believe the numbers that report are grossly under-reported.

I’m a 28-year-old female looking to move from Vancouver to Victoria in the next few weeks (got a job in the area last week and they want me to start ASAP). I thought I had found the perfect place to rent, the Bosa4Rent property at 1008 Pandora, but a friend living in Fernwood cautioned me that there is a lot of drug use along Pandora.

I would be living alone, most likely facing in the complex’ courtyard, but would either take the #95 bus/ ride the Galloping Goose trail to my job out in Colwood. I realize that likely means I’d have to walk down Pandora toward Douglas, though I could go a few blocks down to Yates.

VictoriaBC,Shannon_Canadians,"Has Victoria changed a lot since 2013? Hi! 

I just want to know how much Victoria and Greater Victoria has changed since basically 2013.

I've been told housing's got so expensive locally and there's quite lots of development going on in the Esquimalt? Langford? areas. I've also read that lots of local stores and small businesses have closed down especially during covid - which breaks my heart... is this perhaps how you feel about Victoria Proper and Greater Victoria today in comparison with 2013?

For some context, I was a minor international student to pursue education & new life in Canada as a Grade 8 student living on my own when I first moved to Victoria, Canada back in January 2013.

From what I remember I lived not too far from Camosun College Interurban campus and I used to tak the 30 and/or 31 (Can't recall the exact numbers but I think it was 30 and 31) bus often to go downtown and back home on Friday nights or weekends. 

I left Victoria after 2013 to study at a high school in Toronto and I moved back to the west coast to attend the UBC and currently I've been working locally and I'm proud to be part of the Canadian society as a landed immigrant. 

Just wondering how much Victoria has changed since I left the city back in late 2013! It's a shame but I unfortunately haven't been back to Victoria basically since I left.

I do remember liking the Oak Bay & James Bay areas and the Fisherman's Wharf. The Butchart Gardens were just spectacular and beyond my expectations! Uptown had this cool big Christmas tree up just before I left the city in December and it was memorable! Parts of downtown had little speciality shops and made me feel like I was finally living the life I had always wanted to. And I think there was a new mall being built near Lansdowne Road or Hillside Ave (I think that's what the road was called) at the end of 2013 ish before I left the city. Definitely not talking about the Mayfair mall though!

Anyhow, salute to all of you, and I still carry all the good memories of living in Victoria in my heart, as a young teen boy back in the old days. It is truly my Canadian hometown even if I was not born and raised there for my whole life. I still can't believe it's almost been 10 years since I first came to Victoria and Canada!

I moved to Canada from Korea in grade 8 back in early 2013 on my own. I've lived on the island for like a whole physical year of 2013 and left for high school in Vancouver, Toronto and now back in Vancouver since 2016.  I am strongly considering on applying to go to UVIC to finish my degree starting next year instead of staying in the Lower Mainland to attend a different university like UBC.

I guess I do sort of still remember where things are like malls, grocery stores, parks, etc, but I am hoping to figure out how to find a shared housing/rent as I will still be a student in Victoria again if I do get accepted to UVIC. Do people use craigslist most of the time to find rents? What would be the best move as someone who doesn't currently live on the island look for rent on the island?

If it happens, it is going to be quite a big deal for me to actually decide to leave the Lower Mainland as I've made a lot of connections in this city and nearby cities as well, (which I am very grateful for) but that's how much I do desire to finally go back to Victoria, reconnect with my 2nd hometown of my lifetime, attend UVIC and contribute back to the community in any way I am able to.

VictoriaBC,SharkEyesLemon,"Discussion: Weekly COVID thread? Hi All,

I'm prepared for the downvotes, but am wondering how the community and mods at large feel about putting the covid related posts into a single weekly thread? At the time of writing, on the new or hot page, 4/8 posts I can see are covid related. Between that and the ever present ""I'm moving to Victoria"" threads, with occasional hate for city council and/or the homeless population sprinkled in, it feels like the community is just spinning its wheels in a dust cloud of doom. I would love to see more daily sunset photos, anecdotes about what a weird/great place we live in, advice/question threads where we help eachother out, or I'd even take ""what was that noise"" posts when checking in on the VictoriaBC sub. Instead, I'm more likely to see the global, and ever present arguments of virtue signallers vs conspiracy theorists where each side is trying to gain the moral highground, but really are just contributing the same comments over and over to the echo chamber. Basically, I feel like I'm reading the comments of a Chek News article on Facebook. 

Can we make more room in the sub so it can go back to being a fun, silly place where you can occasionally get good advice on a local burger, or photos of your hikes and the amazing local scenery, and perhaps other (covid safe of course) activities in the region? The masochists among us can still have their say in the weekly thread but it's contained in one bubble (see what I did there) instead of leaking all over the sub.

VictoriaBC,Shima_san,"Email from Councilor Geoff Young re: Campers in Victoria (LONG) Sorry for the length.  This is an unabridged form letter email from Young.

&#x200B;

Thank you for your recent email. 

You are one of hundreds of residents who have written to the mayor and councillors or to the Provincial government (copying us) expressing concerns about tent camps in Beacon Hill Park, Central Park, Centennial Square and the downtown, Cecelia Ravine, Pioneer Square Park, Summit Park, Topaz Park, or elsewhere.  You may have received a reply on behalf of the mayor and council, but since I do not support the policies adopted by the majority of council on this issue I am responding separately. 

Because of the volume of mail on this topic I must send a form letter, attempting to respond to the most frequent questions and comments we have received. I apologize for the letter being so long - we have heard many concerns and suggestions and I have tried to address as many as possible of these issues.

First, I do not agree that we should ever have permitted around-the-clock daytime or permanent camping to become established.  We have seen a number of such encampments in the City and the region and invariably they have inflicted severe negative impacts to residents and businesses in surrounding areas.  They have resulted in increased incidence of theft from yards, vehicles and businesses, confrontations with passers-by, noise at all hours, significant environmental damage requiring costly remediation, discarded garbage, and loss of the use of public space by the public. They have also resulted in danger to some of the residents of the encampments themselves, with violence among campers, fire hazards, and exploitation of young or otherwise vulnerable campers. I cannot understand why our mayor and council did not give more weight to these foreseeable consequences in making their decision to suspend our bylaws against daytime camping.  The courts have said that if adequate shelter space is unavailable we must permit sheltering in parks, but we are not required to allow this all day long.

&#x200B;

There are several reasons why allowing around-the-clock or permanent camping creates so many more problems than the nighttime-only sheltering that the courts require us to allow:

•       Daytime camping is much more attractive to those from out of town – we know campers invariably arrive from elsewhere in response to the availability of free permanent camping in an attractive location.  This is doubly true when other supports such as free meals are available. 

•       Daytime camping allows bigger structures to be erected and more material to be concealed, including stolen items and possibly weapons.

•       These larger permanent structures allow concealment of individuals who may be youths or being sought by the police.

•       Around-the-clock camping requires more toilet facilities convenient to camps, or campers make do without them.

•       Daytime camping results in more environmental damage as campers create space and install tarps, cooking areas etc.resulting in more garbage.

•       Psychologically permanent camping seems to create a sense of “ownership” of space by campers - many residents have reported that campers have been hostile as they pass nearby or take photos.

&#x200B;

•       In brief, the BC court found in 2015 that “it is unsafe for the homeless and other residents of the City to permit any sustained occupation of a particular space by the homeless” \[Abbotsford (City) v. Shantz, paragraph 274\].

&#x200B;

For these reasons I strongly believe the City should immediately reinstate the prohibition against daytime camping.  The reason that has been given for allowing daytime camping, “social distancing”, is manifestly not being observed. 

I am under no illusions that the current out-of-control situation could be quickly remedied. For a period of time enforcement would be difficult and we would have larger gatherings of persons in public spaces around support facilities, but I suspect rather quickly many of the current campers would disperse. 

Where would they go?  There are almost as many answers as people:

•       Many should be in supportive housing or halfway houses

•       Some would go back to their home communities where they may well find support

•       Some are essentially tourists and would choose to visit other communities

•       A surprisingly large number of campers have homes, sometimes shelter rooms or publicly provided housing, or even permanent homes, that they would return to

•       Some may merely find camping more pleasant than working and would seek employment

•       Some appear to have camper vans or small recreational vehicles that they can simply drive to another location

•       When the courts resume regular operation some will be sentenced or remanded in custody

•       Some should possibly be in permanent residential institutions for the mentally ill

•       And some could temporarily be housed in ordinary motel rooms or apartments with minimal supports.

&#x200B;

I know that the current mayor and council have put great stress on the last-mentioned of these options.  They have advocated that the City of Victoria and higher level governments should continue to purchase or create new housing units sufficient to eventually house all of the people camping in our parks and that the problem will then be ended.  I think it has by now become apparent to almost everyone except the mayor and council that this course of action is not successful in the way it is now being carried out, and indeed many letters have pointed out the reasons why it has failed.

The practical problem with this approach is that the numbers of new campers attracted to Victoria’s hospitable location continues to exceed the new units coming on line.  The more fundamental problem is that much of the homelessness we observe is a symptom of an underlying mental health or addictions problem that cannot be easily addressed.  Where this is the case merely housing people without addressing their issues results in negative impacts on surrounding neighborhoods and often chaotic conditions and disorder within the housing units themselves.  This applies to the insufficiently supported housing we have seen at some of the motels that have been repurposed and also at more permanent sites such as 844 Johnson and some of the housing run by non-profits

It is true that negative impacts on surrounding neighborhoods are felt less around the motels and inadequately supervised housing units than they are at the tent camps, since noise is more muffled, fires are less likely, supervision is greater, and people returning “home” with stolen goods may be more noticeable, but many of the basic problems are similar.  And of course, motels tend to attract people from elsewhere in seemingly endless numbers.

&#x200B;

Some writers have suggested putting tent camps in areas that are not environmentally sensitive, such as gravel playing fields or asphalt parking surfaces.  This would address some of the issue of environmental damage but not the other impacts on surrounding areas.  Some writers have further suggested such camps should be fenced and access supervised and controlled.  It certainly seems to make some sense that if the courts require us to allow nighttime sheltering of only the homeless we should be allowed to confirm that campers are indeed homeless.  It also seems to make some sense that we should be able to restrict people from returning to the camp with objects such as furniture and additional bicycles.  However, I suspect we would not be legally permitted to supervise camps in this way.

&#x200B;

I do think that until sufficient numbers of truly supportive and properly supervised permanent housing, or other solutions appropriate to each individual, are available, the City should put some of the resources we have devoted to managing tent camps into temporary night time shelters that meet the requirements of the courts.  My reading of the 2015 court decision about camping in Abbotsford and the court’s reference to the Victoria camping case is that the exact nature of the shelters that would have to be provided in order to allow us to prohibit nighttime sheltering “is yet to be determined”, and will have to be decided once there is a sufficient number of shelter spaces.  However, as a first step we should work toward meeting the court’s requirement for an adequate number of shelter spaces that are safe and acceptable so that we can make the case that we have ended the need to allow sheltering in our parks and public spaces and in the doorways of our businesses. 

&#x200B;

Most of those who have written to us are truly concerned about the plight of those who are homeless because of mental illness or addiction, and wonder where the homeless will go if not to our parks.  They are also troubled by the apparent unwillingness of governments to devote the resources needed to address their issues.  These issues are linked, in my view.  There is a benefit to dispersing the homeless to other communities, rather than concentrating in a few small areas such as the downtown East side of Vancouver or the City of Victoria, which is that they become far more visible to all citizens of the Province, including those that living in ridings that matter politically.  The central cities where “homelessness” has been most visible are politically irrelevant to Provincial governments, since they always vote for the same party in any close election.  As “homelessness” and the underlying issues of addiction and mental illness have become more visible as well as more harmful we are seeing higher levels of government more prepared to spend the money and make the policy changes needed to address them.

&#x200B;

It must be said that many emails I have seen express, sometimes with great passion, vigour or despair,  frustration at what the writer sees as a council of perhaps well-meaning people, many living outside the City and immune from the impacts and costs of the policies they have adopted, who are apparently oblivious to the expressed views of voters who now regret voting them into power.  I do not know whether the mayor and council are indeed acting contrary to the wishes of the majority of residents (naturally we tend to hear mostly from Victorians do not support current policies), but certainly the perception that the council is far out of step with the voters is not conducive to public confidence and useful debate. This is one area where the Provincial government does have a responsibility, simply because the best way to ensure that citizens have confidence in their council is to have more frequent elections.  The four year long council term the Province adopted a few years ago to some degree allows councillors to ignore the voices of citizens, confident that voters will forget the reasons for their indignation by election time.  The four year term is appropriate for elections under the party system, where voters have a good idea what each party represents, but not for a municipal system where councillors may embark on courses of action that are entirely unexpected by those who may have supported them.

Once again, thanks for taking the time to write.  I am always happy to hear the views of Victoria residents though I cannot respond to every letter.

From what I can drag out of him (getting him to explain how he got [scammed](https://seniorsoutreachteam.ca/sure-bet-investment-scam#idiot) is like getting oil from a rock) he was defrauded of his mother's funds while she was hospitalized, and these ""business partners"" have recently been calling their home and demanding money from mum because ""the business is doing well but the business needs more of your savings"".

There was this man whom had only lived here since 2006, came up onto the stage to present his point on why the rezoning shouldn't go through, and his point was that when he lived in LA back in the 70's he didn't like how the development back then turned out with Orange County. He also brought up that if this goes through, only the corporate businesses will be affected (or he just failed to mention any of the many small businesses), he even had the gall to say that Save-on-Foods might shut down, like that would even matter, we definitely have enough grocery stores as it is (three, if you're unaware). If you're not a Sidney resident, you've probably never heard about the anti-gateway petition, which was a huge, unfair way to present their point. I'm sure a sizeable percentage of signatures were just people who would sign anything. Another point against the petition is that they got around 2000 signatures, less than 1/5^th of the total population, and they never gave anyone a chance to say yes to the project.  The only person who was up on stage who seemed to be somewhat sane, was the man who talked about performing an actual referendum to make a decision, I never caught any names disappointingly as I guess I came a little too late and had to sit outside at the back.  There was also a rule made clearly at the beginning that there would be no clapping for any statements, which was broken pretty quickly, if the speaker made some shitty pun about the community or the gateway.  The venue seemed strategically chosen for the anti-gateway crowd, it was the Shoal Centre, if you don't know, it's the major senior home in town. The whole place is full of anti-progression old people who love the ""small town charm"" that Sidney supposedly has. A point that I would have liked to make if I had the chance to stay, is that about 50% of the people who have an opposing opinion will not be alive to see whatever happens with with decision.

VictoriaBC,SickSwan,"Probably Just The Latest In A Long Line Of Urbexing Request Threads For those unfamiliar: 
Urbexing is the hobby of exploring abandoned buildings. I go in, I walk around. Sometimes I take pictures. It's neat.

I've tried looking through this sub/around reddit for some urbexing spots around the city spesifically, but have mostly come up dry. Everything I have been able to find on reddit is a few years old and the info is outdated (people discussing how to explore a building that's since been reno'd or torn down ect).

VictoriaBC,SkibumG,"Small scale landscaper/designer to create a plan Hoping people can help me here, I'm looking for a landscaper/designer to help me develop a plan for my garden. Before you suggest it, I have looked at the archives, and I wrote down lots of previous options. 

My problem is that when I call those companies, and they hear I don't have $30-80K to spend this year, they don't want to come out and even look at the property, and they don't want to just develop a plan for me. 

Around 2 years ago I bought a house in Saanich that is a complete blank slate, garden wise. It's a good sized lot (50x170), facing south, but it's pretty much all grass. I liked the idea of building a garden, but honestly I'm overwhelmed. I know I can DIY lots of it, and will hire out for bigger jobs, but I would really like a plan to work with, and I just don't think it's something I can do myself. 

Ideally, I would work with someone (and pay them!) to develop a plan for me, with suggestions for the order in which larger things e.g. hardscaping should be done. I did this with my previous house in Oaklands and was really happy with how the process worked. As I saved money, I contacted the landscaper and some things she helped with with, some she didn't. (Sadly she's no longer in business.)

I'd like to have a rough plan in place by early spring, so I could start doing some of the work and save money for specific things. For example, I was going to build raised beds for veggies last summer, but I couldn't even decide where I wanted to put them and got stuck. 

I'm happy to work with the landscaper's firm on big hardscaping when I can afford it, but I don't want to waste anyone's time (including my own), with a mismatch in expectations. I expect this garden will take quite a few years to build, I just need some help getting me going. Also I'm really sick of mowing so much grass.

194 days ago it snowed for the first time this winter (September 19 is actually still summer but I digress), yesterday I woke up to take the kids to the bakery for a fresh loaf of bread for breakfast and it was like -23°C. I live in Edmonton, but I don’t really want to anymore. I want to live in Victoria, or maybe just on the island somewhere. 

Currently we have $350k in our investment accounts. And about $80k of equity in our $400k house. A similar home in Victoria (suburb) would be about $600k. I’m somewhat okay with dipping into the savings to facilitate the move, HOWEVER, here’s the tricky bit. I’m in oil and gas. Specifically welding. I am a journeyman welder by trade but more recently I’ve been involved in project and quality management. I don’t imagine that a trades skill set that will translate very well to the island, but possibly I am wrong.

How do people on the island afford to live there?  What do the 360,000 people from Victoria do for work?

It seems like I'll be able to find work for $30 if I can find some welding work but that would take a big chunk out of my investments to afford a house and be able to keep the payments going on $60k/yr. In 4 years my wife will be able to start helping out again, but she never had any schooling past high school so shes realistically looking at something minimum wage herself.

So what do I do? Drain my savings to live somewhere better? Go back to school for something BC relevant? I know this is a bit of a ramble at this point but I just wanted to put the feelers out to the people in this sub and see what your thoughts are.

The height of summer is one of the busiest times at the farm – tours, tastings, live entertainment, food, drink…the list goes on. This year, it has also been a busy planning period for our new location in Victoria. Some of you have seen the drawings for our next new venture up at our farm in Cobble Hill. Others have seen the fence banners at the Victoria       location site itself, which is across from Point Hope Shipyard. And, many of you have asked, “when is the opening date?”     
   
Well, we have certainly hit some bumps, but Dockside is still coming. We are taking the following approach: Good things take time, great things take more time, and truly exceptional things take even more. Or, patience is a virtue that is often rewarded, or a stitch in time…. There are so many sayings to explain how we feel but we are getting so close and we       are almost there.   
   
It is a complex design project that combines sustainability with integration into a growing community while still focusing on the guest experience. We obtained our Development permit approval from City Council last September and submitted our application for a building permit in December, but we are still waiting for our final building permit       approval. We have been working closely with planners and building inspectors at the City to fine-tune the design in a way that allows our future customers to get the most out of their experience in the new space.  
   
The new building is designed to create an inclusive space with no wall between the production and guest areas, and the rooftop patio is designed to present views of the shipyard and city in a way that is sensitive to the neighbourhood. These criteria are taking a bit more time to sort out with the helpful people at the City, but once we get our building permit we will start mobilizing on the site and we can’t wait!   
   
Thanks for your continued support and patience. We hope to see you in Cobble Hill soon.

VictoriaBC,South-Lobster,"TEACHING IN BC Looking for teachers of Victoria to help me out...

I finished teacher's college in the summer of 2020, and also have a Master's in Teaching. Due to COVID, finding my first teaching job has been a challenge, especially in Ontario. So I have been thinking of relocating in order to gain teaching experience and work. I have been reading many posts that BC does not pay well compared to Ontario...

Regardless, I want to keep my options open. To start I created an account with Make a Future and looking for jobs. I'm qualified to teach Elementary.  But I don't know what to do next. I am feeling overwhelmed and anxious.  We are in October I feel like I'm late on the hiring season, finding work etc

I don't know anyone or never have I been to Victoria, BC. So this would be a BIG step and move for me.  I want to teach in the public school sector with a small to the decent school and/or classroom.

I'm looking to rent a small place for myself and my pet. Nothing fancy but something clean and VERY SAFE to live. Does anyone know if Make to Future helps relocating teachers with finding housing accommodations or gives incentives for that?  Also, I would be taking public transit everywhere.

Please if you have experience living and teaching in Victoria Bc, relocated to BC from Ontario or other provinces to teach in Victoria. Thank you for all your insights!","BC Housing, Lived Experience, Sooke Transition House Society",1,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,Southern-Revolution6,"My parked car got scratched in a parking lot, do I have to pay deductibles if I'm not responsible? My car was parked in a parking lot and I had gone to the store to grab some food, when I came back a car was pulling into the spot next to mine. The front of their car was pressing and scratching the rear right side of my car as he tried to park next to me. I had to tell them to stop and got their information because it left three scratches on my new Honda Civic. I have filled a claim with ICBC and gave them all the information on the incident. I was not in the car and I had parked away from cars and wasn't over any lines, so I wondered would I be charged at all for this repair?

They’re a bit elderly so am trying to avoid the pub places that my wife and I usually randomly search and walk into.

Any help or suggestions will be appreciated!

Edit: so many suggestions in short time! Thank you so much everyone! Will run these by the big boss (wife) over lunch and see which ones fit their tastes better but love the ones with the bits about ambiences, views etc!

Edit 2: not sure how many who gave suggestions will see this edit but wanted to thank you all. Gave them the choices and they decided on Bodega to be adventurous …unfortunately…they spent so much time walking around Butchart Gardens this afternoon taking pictures (close to 5 hours)….they were completely tuckered and passed out when I drove them back to the hotel at 5. 

Ended up ordering combination of door dash and room service because they didn’t wanna go out :(.

Strangely, over on r/LangfordBC a new minutes ago, someone posted a link to an [article](https://www.saanichnews.com/news/public-hearing-set-for-proposed-6-storey-apartment-building-in-colwood/) in the Saanich News dated Feb 21st, announcing that a ""Public hearing set for proposed 6-storey apartment building in Colwood"".

The problem is that this public hearing was for Feb 22nd - the next day.  Even stranger was the included line in the article, 

""Those looking to participate may do so in writing before Feb. 22 by email at [publichearing@colwood.ca](mailto:publichearing@colwood.ca), mail to 3300 Wishart Rd., Colwood, BC V9C 1R1, or by hand delivery to city hall.""

It's possible that the Saanich News only received the information that day or the day before; or even earlier and was only able to publish it on Feb 21st.  But it seems more like what's known as a 'Friday News Dump' (where the government will announce unpleasant things on a Friday because most people won't read/watch on a Friday).

I've emailed the paper to ask why this happened.

VictoriaBC,SpinCharm,"Geezer Rant: Where can I buy a simple sheet of glass without forced explanations? [Update:  thanks to the many that recommended Glass Smith. Got a quote that was 1/3rd the price elsewhere, and they’ll cut the pieces themselves, with no hassles ordering. Done!   Also great tips on looking second hand, which hasn’t occurred to me.]

I'm having trouble finding a store I can just buy some glass from.  Everyone wants to sell me tempered, sanded, acid-etched, beveled, or whatever value-added products they have, or I end up in long conversations about what exactly I plan to use it for so that they can decide what I should be doing.

You'd think it was simple to do this, wouldn't you.

No.

I don't want or need that.  Just sell me a piece of glass that's about 3' x 1' and I'm happy to cut it and sand the edges myself.  I'm finding myself getting drawn into lengthy explanations and being offered solutions that cost well over $150, and essentially refusal to just sell me a basic piece of glass.

So all I want is a piece of glass.  Doesn't anyone sell a sheet of glass for a few bucks?  Do we live in such a risk-adverse society now that a guy has to have a discussion about the whys and wherefores of using said glass before someone will consent to sell it?  When I'm out buying a piece of wood, or a piece of sheet steel, I'm not forced into discussions with Home Depot reps about it (unless I want to).  I don't have my choices and needs analysed and scrutinized by Home Hardware employees before they'll consent to sell me something they've decided I need.  I simply buy the thing.

Yet glass seems to be this carefully hoarded product that only experts can decide how I'll use it.

Just sell me a damn piece of sheet glass please.  If you can tell me the cost of a couple of different thicknesses, I'll decide myself the rest.

>“It would be irresponsible for us to not try for an injunction again.”

>The Office of the Fire Commissioner inspected the camp Wednesday and concluded that “there has been deterioration of the camp since the last inspection.”

>The report also notes that the excessive storage of combustibles throughout the camp appears to be increasing.

>“Overall the danger to life safety created by the fire hazards is increasing and is considered to be only a matter of time before a serious fire incident occurs.”

>The government failed in its previous attempt to get an injunction. But Coleman believes the growing fire safety concerns, combined with rising levels of crime and violence in the area, will bolster the province’s case.

VictoriaBC,StackLeeAdams,"Here’s a list of the new COVID-19 restrictions announced today **Three-week circuit breaker begins now to bend the curve, protect people**

VICTORIA – To address rising COVID-19 case counts, protect people and communities and help break the chain of COVID-19 transmission, the provincial health officer is amending the provincial public health orders effective midnight tonight, March 30, 2021.
“COVID-19 continues to create challenges for people and businesses throughout B.C., and we are grateful for the sacrifices people continue to make to keep one another safe,” said Premier John Horgan. “We know that the idea of more restrictions is not welcome news, but we are asking people to rise to the challenge with the confidence that vaccines mean better days are ahead. We are not out of the woods yet, but the provincial health officer’s orders, combined with our vaccines, give us the tools we need to move out of this pandemic together.”

New and amended orders and guidelines are in effect through April 19, 2021, and include:

- For restaurants, bars and pubs, all food and liquor-serving premises must only provide take-out or delivery service. Dine-in service is prohibited, except for outdoor patios. People dining on patios should do so with their immediate household or core bubble.

- Indoor, adult group fitness activities of any kind are also paused. Gyms and fitness centres are restricted to individual or one-on-one activities only i.e. one-on-one personal training.
The previously announced class variance for limited indoor worship services has been suspended. Outdoor worship services under the current variance may continue.

- Travel continues to be limited to essential travel, work or medical reasons only. For those who have travelled outside their health region, if you or anyone in your family develops any signs of illness, you must stay home from work, school or daycare, and arrange to get tested immediately.

- Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort is closed through to April 19, 2021, to address and prevent community spread related to non-essential travel.

- All workers are strongly encouraged to work from home, where possible.

- Public health guidance for schools has also been amended to support and encourage students down to Grade 4 to wear masks while at school.

“Rising case levels, variants of concern, increased transmission and an increase in more severe cases are huge concerns,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “B.C. public health officials are making the tough choices now to break the chain and protect our communities.”
Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, said: “Social connection is important, and so is keeping our loved ones and ourselves safe. We all have a choice – to stay safe or put our loved ones, our friends and ourselves at risk, which is why non-essential activities need to be limited and need to be outside with the same small number of people. The sacrifices we make today will help all of us to get through this storm.”

They propose a four-point plan, to be executed in the following order:

1. Conduct an intensive outreach program with those on the street to build a relationship and understand how they ended up there, and what it would take to get them off the street, especially understanding their health, housing and sheltering needs.
2. Provide and place people in a range of housing and sheltering options, including emergency low-barrier shelters, long-term shelters, complex-care housing, transitional housing, and permanent supportive and independent housing. Remove the street and parks as being the normalized, sanctioned, and viable housing option it has become.
3. Support people to access a range of physical, mental illness, and addictions services and interventions, including trauma-informed counselling, institutional mental-health care, complex care, primary care, transitional treatment, detox, treatment, and recovery; and move beyond harm reduction as being the sole response to people’s addiction and health needs. In extreme situations, this care needs to be involuntary.
4. Support the police and judicial system to incarcerate the small number of “bad operators” on the street — those who are dangerous, and extremely physically and sexually violent, and those who traffic unhoused people, mainly women — and repeat offenders. This is not criminalizing homelessness or poverty but recognizing that unhoused people are disproportionately the victims of crime and deserve the same protection as housed citizens.","Aboriginal Coalition to End Homelessness, Addict, Addicted, Community Plan to End Homelessness , Complex care , Crime , Emergency Housing , Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness , Harm Reduction, Homeless, Homelessness , Makola Housing Society , Our Place, Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, Peers Victoria Resources Society , Poverty, Service provider , Shelter, Sooke Transition House Society, Unhoused , Victoria Sexual Assault Centre, Victoria Women in Need, Victoria Women's Transition House",1,True,0.0

VictoriaBC,SteamboatRyan,"Looking for Minimum Mortgage Down Payment Information for First Time Home Buyer Hello there,

My family of 3 is looking to purchase our first home is Victoria. With housing prices soaring in town, we've started looking outside of Victoria as well. Looking for a 3bed, 2 bath single family detached house.

I'm looking for both a recommendation for a mortgage broker as well as any advice or clarification around my understanding of minimum down payment in BC. I would love to put down more than a minimum but we just can't (no equity, no family inheritance, no rich family, no lottery winnings)

My understanding is under 500k homes, min down payment is 5%. Between 500k and 1M, it's 10% on anything over 500k (so 25k +10% of anything over 500k). And anything >$1M requires a minimum 20% down payment.

So if my understanding of the minimum is accurate, the min down payment for a home that is $999,999 would be ~$75,000. But the minimum for a $1,000,000 home is $200,000. The reason I bring this up is because the average price in Victoria is over $1,000,000 now as of September 2021. There's no chance we're saving close to $200k anytime soon...

If my calculations are correct (min $75k for up to $999k home), are there any mortgage companies that would give a mortgage to someone with only that much. Our household income is about $160,000 so I think that should qualify for a $4k monthly mortgage, which is what I think a 2% interest rate would amount to.

Is my calculation correct, and if so, is it realistic in that we could get approval for a mortgage on a $999,999 home with a down payment of $75k?

And are there any recommendations for a mortgage broker, or if thats not allowed, any advice about what to look for in a mortgage broker, and what to expect etc.? 

Thanks in advance, and sorry if anything is outside of the rules here, I don't post often.

Looking forward to the conversation.","BC Housing, Home, WiN",1,True,0.0

VictoriaBC,Strong_Daffodil,"Artist's and other creatives priced out of the city Over the last couple years (this was starting to happen even pre-covid) I've seen more and more artists, poets, writers, and other creatives get priced out of the city. It has gotten to the point where the city has started to feel pretty soulless, there aren't many cool art exhibitions or projects and those that are left are shitty and clearly just made to be sold to some rich boomer, or made by some retired banker who's decided to dip his feet into some medium, usually in the form of a shitty watercolor landscape being put up in his buddies gallery. It feels like there isn't really any vibrant music, or art scenes here anymore because the people that create those scenes need to be able to pour there heart and soul into them. But they can't because they simply can't afford to take the time to do that here. So I'm curious if you all know of 

1) any cool creative scenes in town (not to be ageist but I don't mean a couple of retired folks getting together and painting) and 

2) Where in Canada is that still a thing? Victoria used to be a bit Hotspot for that sort of thing in BC but it certainly is feeling less (I know it was greatly affected by covid, but this was starting to happen pretty heavily even before covid) like that anymore, so where are all the creatives moving? Are there any smaller towns with good scenes. I've heard better things about Montreal but I don't speak French very well so I'm hesitant to move there.

Victoria needs to realize that, yes the climate is nice here, but that isn't the only reason why people like this town, more and more minimum wage workers, creatives, people that maintain the beautiful parks, and city are all being priced out of this city. And whilst yes the city is undeniably pretty (for Canada) and has a nice climate (for Canada) it is going to go to shit as more stores close down due to lack of minimum wage workers, less care and upkeep due to those people moving away, and less creative scenes to witness, art projects to experience, and overall fun things to do in town dissappear from creatives moving away. This town is gonna be pretty awful if it continues like this when 15 years down the line its filled with nothing but retirees, lawyers and doctors. Even students at Uvic are gonna start swapping to online school in larger numbers if things don't change. Yes Uvic is building more student housing, which is a good call on their part, but still the vast majority of students are living off campus. I suppose though in their case you will always have foreign students from rich families coming here because it looks better on a resume in China and India if they got educated overseas.

* People care about the environment, and are generally more left-leaning politically.
* A lot more older vehicles on the road. I imagine its because road salt doesn't lead to rust on cars here?
* City lights are timed perfect for pedestrians... You never stand at an intersection for long before the light changes... It's amazing, I've honestly never experienced anything like this before.
* People in cars LOVE honking their horns, but idk if its road rage or that small town ""hey I know you"" honk. Haven't paid close enough attention.
* A lot of homeless people.

* From Downtown, if you go too far East, if you go too far North or too far South - you'll find a much higher proportion of 65 yo + people. (Haven't gone too far West yet)
* Kind/chill/laid back atmosphere. People aren't very on edge, and definitely are not all money minded. They seem to actually care about each other, and it shows in how they speak to you.

VictoriaBC,SuperBearJew,"Transit option to/from the airport is unacceptable I recently flew home from a trip into YYJ and for the first time, decided to bus home. My trip was miserable, and it provides an offensive first experience in the city for visitors. 

First, and less importantly, the 88 bus is absurd. It is primarily used to get from the airport to the McTavish exchange or vice-versa, yet because it loops around Sidney so much, travellers are forced to wait half an hour for a bus trip of roughly 2 km. Not far at all, but too long to walk with luggage, along the road. 

Second, and more concerning: I got to the McTavish exchange at ~11:45 on Sunday, with the 70/72 coming once per hour. When the 12:15 bus came by the exchange, it was completely full and blew past the stop without even rolling into the exchange to explain. After confirming via NextRide that the bus was indeed not coming for another full hour, I wrangled some other travellers to split a cab. 

It is a slap in the face to visitors to the city to drop them at a bus exchange in the-middle-of-nowhere with no services. If one got to the stop that day at 11:20, waiting to go downtown, they would have been waiting nearly two hours for a bus downtown. 

There was an older woman with a among my group of fellow travellers at the exchange. I hate to present extreme what-ifs, but it is easily conceivable that an older person could become quite ill in the sun on a hot day there. Again, the lack of services at the exchange is part of this issue.

Hear me out: Victoria was built with an amazing electrified streetcar system that reached every corner of the city in the 1890s, and while it was scrapped in the 1950s for buses, I think there's still a need for more concrete commuter options around the region. Specifically, the Douglas St corridor from the Museum all the way to Langford will one day, in the not so distant future, reach such high levels of congestion that even rapid bus lanes will be unable to keep up with capacity. The existing road is only 2 lanes in each direction, which is not nearly enough to support the huge influx of new development in Langford. While I believe they could refresh the existing right-of-way tracks from Vic West to Langford, the fact they didn't incorporate rail on the new Johnson St bridge adds a huge cost to bringing the service into dt, and it also doesn't pass through any really significant dense residential or commercial areas.

VictoriaBC,TALPERS,"Disputing fine for a speeding ticket, advice? First things first, I was definitely speeding. I take responsibility for that. Just looking for advice regarding my situation. 

In April, I was issued a ticket by Sidney RCMP at that end stretch of HWY 17; and yes, I get it, I should've known in that area... It was in contravention of MVA 146(3) which is speeding between 21-40 against a highway sign. This ticket carries a $196 fee. 

As it was 8:30, I was being dumb, trying to rush for the 9pm ferry home. I was actually moving back to Vancouver with all my stuff in my car when I was caught, funny. I am a N driver, with 2 1/4 years of safe driving with no other violations. In addition, my N was displayed at the time (which I feel might have made me a bit of a target, but that's irrelevant).

The officer pulled me over and asked for my license and insurance. He then told me I was going to receive a ticket and returned to his vehicle. He produced the ticket and briefly chatted to me about the contents of my car (""wow, lots of stuff"", ""oh, you're a UVIC student, sounds tough"", and ""well, I hope you'll make the ferry, it's not too full."") He also told me about how he had dashcam footage of me for about 5km, speeding most of the way. He told me about the dispute process and then bid me a good day.

I have since then filed a Notice of Dispute regarding the fine, pending a court date (which ICBC says could be more than a year away).

There are a few questions I have:

1) I've read up on ""Fatal Errors"" on a ticket. The officer has put ""22:30"" on the ticket, which is obviously wrong since I was on the 9 o'clock ferry and not off that until 22:45. Is there any validity to this claim? I also know that a changed ticket may be reissued within a year, but if my court date is a year away so this cannot happen, is there any way to change my Notice of Dispute to fighting the allegation instead of the fine? 

2) If I'm found/plead guilty, will I be forced to restart my N? I've heard conflicting reports on this. It is my first offence and only carries 3 points. 

3) Is there any chance of getting a reduced fee? I'm a full-time university student working only part-time for food and rent and while $196 doesn't break the bank, that's just a bit over two weeks of food and rent. I have had no previous run-ins with the law, how likely is it that the Justice/Peace Officer will reduce my fine?

VictoriaBC,Talzon70,"Are we building enough housing? If we control for household size, maybe we are. I decided to have a look at the data, because every time people start talking about housing affordability, someone inevitably starts claiming that we are building tons of housing.  I've always disagreed with that claim, largely because every time I've looked at housing starts it has been below population growth.

However, I had never really looked deep into the data, partly because the CMHC data portal sucks if you want to look at multiple years, for some reason.  While exploring the data, I realized people don't usually live alone, so I decided to also control for household size.

Results:

[Housing Construction Shortfall Estimate for Victoria CMA for 2011-2021 Based on CMHC data \(2011-2021\) and Census data \(2011 & 2016\)](https://preview.redd.it/j9mc445nrob81.png?width=2163&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f15cd6d64b247ea56cc308caff93dd463e1043c)

* There is a shortfall of about 21000 units if you don't control for household size over the last 10 years.
* There is actually a surplus of housing production of about 6700 units if you control for average BC household size.

Limitations:

* All housing is not created equal:
   * Cursory glances at the data show lots of apartments, which usually have less space and can accommodate less people, especially studios and 1-bedroom apartments.
   * This data treats a unit built in Sooke or Sidney the same as a unit built in Victoria or Langford.  Location matters a lot in the real world, especially for transportation and time costs.
* Household sizes are not uniform, there are far more small households than large ones in the real world.
* This doesn't account for underused or vacant units, which matter for affordability.
* Calculations are not sophisticated in the slightest (e.g. population estimates).
* I assumed all starts and completions represent new housing units.

Final thoughts:

It was very interesting to find that there isn't an obvious shortage of housing construction when controlling for household size.  It seems we actually are building quite a bit of housing in Greater Victoria, so some of the naysayers may have a point.

Unfortunately, this data only represents a small part of the picture.  Even if we are building enough housing in Greater Victoria, most people on the ground can see that where we are building that housing is very uneven.  Tons of units are going up in Langford and further out towards Sooke, but it's not keeping up with demand in other areas.  This is going to be an ongoing issue for transportation and affordability in the region for decades if changes aren't made.

VictoriaBC,Talzon70,"Victoria is so desirable that the entire western world is having a cost of living crisis! Everyone in the whole world wants to live in Victoria.  That's why Toronto and Vancouver and the small town of 20,000 people I grew up in all have a housing crisis.  It's because so many people are trying to move to Victoria that many of them are missing by thousands of kilometers.

Furthermore, everywhere else is garbage.  Nobody likes mountains and access to amazing views out of their front window.  Nobody likes living next to a beautiful lake or only a short drive from some of the best skiing and snowmobiling in the world.  Everyone loves the temperate climate of Victoria.  Nobody likes snow and nobody likes the hotter weather offered in places further South.

People are lining up to live in Victoria because we have the best restaurants in the world, we have the best natural beauty in BC and the world, and we have the best access to doctors for retirement age people.  You can definitely take my word for it.  The temperate rainforests, fjords, rocky mountains, wine country, boreal forests, and wine country areas available in BC are all super lame.

So many people have moved here recently that people even want to move here to be close to their families.  We even have the best transportation system in the world.  Everyone is just dying to come enjoy the relaxing Colwood crawl, the exhilaration of driving the Malahat to get Up Island, or riding the bus, which is always on time and takes you right where you need to go.

There's tons of jobs here and they all pay extremely well and are easy to get.  Especially all those government jobs, we all know the provincial government loves giving out raises and hasn't been trying to cut costs.  You can come here and make bank with no prior skills or experience.

Or maybe you're wealthy or retiring, you don't need a job then.  This is the best possible place you could choose to live out your final days.  You certainly wouldn't want to live near family in your final years and there's no chance you'd find a beautiful place where you can work on your tan like you can in Victoria.

This housing crisis is about how amazing Victoria is to live in.  It's certainly not a combination of poor land use planning and slow development caused by NIMBYs, stagnant wages and rising inflation due to loose monetary policy, and poor management of the economy by our provincial and federal government.

You could build a million houses or apartments in the core and it would make no difference.

The other day I was at a shop in Langford. This woman starts berating the cashier over 2 cents. She's screaming that if an item is X.23 then she shouldn't have to pay X.25. That they are scamming her and if they round up, why don't they round down (they do), and that pennies are redundant and shouldn't be considered.

Obviously this makes zero sense as she's basically arguing against what she believes while trying to humiliate a service employee making min wage so she can feel superior.

I was in line but I *hate* when people pull this shit. People are entitled, and if the public or their friends don't call them on their behaviour, and make it socially unacceptable, it will never end.

So I leaned over and called to her and told her that 1. They DO round down if an item is .22 or less.
And
2. Someone of *her age* should have enough common sense and decency to NOT treat someone like garbage just because she's too stupid to understand how math, and currency laws work.

She ended up grabbing her stuff and huffing and puffing out of the store.

* Do a self-assessment and find info here :

https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/symptoms-and-testing

* If the self-assessment indicates you should be tested, give the VIHA Covid Test Appointment phone number a call:  1-844-901-8442

* Leave your phone number, and someone will call you back to do another assessment and ask some questions.

* Depending on their assessment, you may be sent an email with a link to book an at home test kit pick up;
or in-person PCR test;
or just be told to isolate at home and seek medical help if symptoms worsen. 

*If you're directed to do a Rapid Test at home, you click on the link provided in your email, book a date/time and go pick up your test kit (or have the PCR test done if that's what they say).

**** Test pick up locations are NOT pedestrian friendly! Most everyone is in a vehicle, so when you arrive, ask the person directing traffic if you need to stand in line with the cars, or if there is a diff area for people on foot****

The people working at the testing sites dont get paid nearly enough for what they're doing. VIHA needs to pay them more money. They're doing an incredible job and we should be prioritising their pay and training above other HC positions. 🖤

Purchased 2 x 6-packs on Nov 30th and had to pay $10 to have them mailed to me.  They didn't hit the post office until Dec 10th.  Could have gone to the one location in Victoria to purchase them in person, but figured getting them mailed was safer during a pandemic...  Bulk mail stamp on the exterior of the envelope $0.71 in the package that was sitting in my mailbox when I got home Jan 3rd.  As it was, had to wait in a huge line while the 2 customer service agents re-issued the passes (they had a long list of people who were in a similar boat).

Got to the top of the mountain just fine on Jan 2nd.  Upper Lots all full but able to snag a spot in the Overflow lot.  Lots of encouragement from the mountain to ""tailgate"" and avoid the crowds inside, but no toilets, or other supports (like outdoor covered seating etc...) despite promises made in their newsletter sent earlier in the season.  Snowing heavily during the day so our plans to tailgate were put aside for the chance to sit inside and dry off.

Around 2:45 one of the lifties informed us that the road down was closed.  Next pass by, they advised that the road was open again but that chains were mandatory to head down.  Got to the Overflow lot and into our 4x4 SUV around 3:30.  So much heavy wet snow had fallen during the day that the vehicle high centered in the unplowed lot when we tried to pull out.  Got out the shovel and was able to dig out the vehicle and with a push we were able to join the line of cars trying to leave the parking lot.  It took us 4 hours to get from the Overflow Lot to the turnoff to the Hawk Chair.  Not a single Mt.Washington staff member around -- no communications via Twitter, nobody directing traffic nothing.  Once traffic was rolling again took another full hour to get down the mountain.  5 hours to travel a distance that usually takes 35 mins.  I understand that much of this delay was weather caused, but holy shit, it's not like this snow was unforecasted.

The disappointing thing to me was that at around 3:30 the roadway was more-or-less not plowed.  I don't blame the plow drivers at all, but Mountain Operations needs to take some responsibility here.  By 7pm we counted 5 plows on the roadway, and when they finally got going, they had the roads well cleared.  If it's snowing heavily all day, and you have thousands of vehicles at the top of your mountain that you know are going to start coming down around 3pm, those plows should be rolling all-day-long, not waiting until the last moment to clear the roadways...

This morning I checked Twitter and the Mount Washington website to see their very excited ""Powder Alert"" messages about 67cms of ""powder"" that the roads were plowed and bare.  We packed up our stuff and started the drive only to find a STOPPED line of cars at the highway turnoff.  Road was indeed well plowed and bare.  It took us close to 90 mins to reach the Sunrise lot, only to find it Full.  Another 30 minutes to reach the Overflow lot only to encounter a Lot Attendant who informed us that ALL PARKING LOTS were full.  That our only options were to see if ""Maybe the Nordic Centre Lot has space"" or to drive back down the mountain and ""Take a Shuttle"".  We did the math and figured 30 mins down, wait for the delayed Shuttle, 90 mins back up would see us take our first run around 2pm so we turned around and drove back to Victoria.

So where the f\*\*k is Mount Washington's management?  Why isn't there anyone taking responsibility to deliver a better customer experience? Yes, I get it, snow messes things up but this snowfall was forecast and it's not like it hasn't snowed there before -- you're a f\*\*king ski hill -- working with falling snow is part of your DNA.  And yes, I also get that there is a pandemic going on and that workers are in short supply but they need to figure something out.  If you want to pack the ski hill every day you NEED the staff to support the guests, otherwise, you need to limit the number of visitors to your establishment.  How about ""advanced reservations"" and/or deployment of car counting technology and signage that tells people the lots are full (hell, even BCFerries can do this, and they aren't the most technology savvy).  No problem using Twitter, Facebook, Email and their Website to blast all their clients about the 67cm of fresh Powder, but no duty to communicate timely updates what-so-ever the customers that you attract.  The Twitter update letting customers know the parking lots were full came at 10:30 -- this was well after we had turned around and were headed back down the mountain, literally passing HUNDREDS of cars on their way up.

I am beyond disappointed in you Mt.Washington.  You can do better by your customers.

We are supposed to encourage our youth to march across the picket lines, holding a sign made from 100% recycled fair-trade paper, affixed to wood recycled from all the signs that litter the streets after each election, and work their asses off to fix the problem.** 

**But we've somehow taught them that a stop-work industrial action against planet Earth can accomplish the aim of saving planet Earth.**

**The reason the politicians aren’t able to fix the problems, is because they are elected leaders in a representative democracy, who are therefore unable to accomplish their constituent’s demands in an effective manner, as it is not in their constituents interests for them to do so, and consequently not in their interest to do so.** 

**Let me illustrate with a simple example: Adam, Bill and Charlie elect Dave to be their representative leader, who will do what needs doing. Then they tell Dave the environment needs fixing as number 1 priority. Dave applies political pressure, and finally gets funding to fix the environment of his riding shifted to his control.** 

**Edward oversaw the fixing of the environment in Dave’s riding, before Dave got the funding withdrawn for his environmental services company’s contract. This caused Edward to have to lay off Frank, the guy he had hired to work on it using 60% of the funding. 75% including the truck lease. As Frank leaves his truck keys on the table, Edward suggests Frank talk to Adam, Bill and Charlie to gain employment again. Frank does.**

**Adam is happy Dave is finally doing something about the environment, and regrets Frank’s employment was terminated. Adam drives a Volt, so he is already doing his part, but he assures Frank something will come up, and Dave will make effective use of the money to integrate the parts together to fix the environment.**

**Bill is a teacher, busy educating future leaders on how to effectively campaign for someone to fix the planet. He too is doing more than his fair share, with this burden. And on a teacher’s salary, he and the wife can barely pay the mortgage on their rental condo, not to mention their house. After mentioning he stopped using plastic bags for his shopping years before it was mandatory, he tells Frank that he knows Charlie from whom he bought the condo, is doing something big for the environment.**

**Charlie is indeed. Charlie is a developer, but one more concerned about the planet’s health than making money. As such, he has already set aside half the money Dave obtained for funding, to fund a campaign to raise awareness of the new Society that has been set up to provide environmental certification for proposed developments in the area, before they go to Dave for approval. Unfortunately Frank does not have the necessary degree in soil sciences or biology that would be required to consider him for the field position at the society, and as Charlie informs him, Charlie recused himself from any part in the Society beyond its initiation, and is not taking so much as a cent from it, to avoid a conflict of interest. But he encourages Frank to apply for the position anyway, as he seems like a capable guy who could maybe get past the credential check.**

**Frank does. He never gets a response to his email, so he emails to follow up, again. He never gets a response to his email, so he calls the number on the website. The lady who answers says they cannot divulge why he was not accepted for an interview, due to privacy reasons. Frank asks her to check that they got his application at least. She searches with suspiciously loud random sounding typing, and eventually says she found it. Frank asks when it was received. She says she cannot divulge that information due to privacy reasons. Frank hangs up the phone, before swearing at her for several minutes. Then the doorbell rings. It’s Bill, checking up as he hasn’t received Frank’s rent payment which was due today.**

**Frank spends the next few years measuring the efficiency of the new Society, and after eventually obtaining their financial records from a dumpster, puts all his information together into a report, proving how only 1% of the money Dave directed to fix the environment is used to directly benefit the environment. Frank emails this to the media. He never gets a response to his email, so he emails to follow up. Frank hates the stares people give him when he goes to Starbucks or the library to send emails and charge his phone, which he now uses to use to write his reports from his tent-office. But he knows things are about to change.**

**He never gets a reply to his follow up, so Frank goes to the media’s office. Frank asks at reception to speak to the person who receives emails sent to where he sent his email. After a long conversation, a security guard comes and asks if there is a problem. Frustrated, Frank asks the security guard why the media haven’t acted.** 

**After explaining his report, Frank receives a surprisingly eloquent response, including the security guard’s theory that the media only wants to print or air stories that show the system is working, as they have gradually become an integrated part of the system, instead of an entity that places itself outside the system. The security guard introduces himself. He is also Frank. Mollified somewhat that at least someone ‘gets it’, and happy at the coincidence of them** **having the same name as him, Frank wishes the security guard, “have a good day,” and leaves the offices.** 

**Frank begins to walk back to the semi-hidden path through the brambles to his tent, in the park he pitches his tent in. Frank likes this spot because he has been there over a month and the police have not yet arrived with a complaint to indicate he has been noticed by a local resident. Like that one lady who yelled at him and said he was ruining the environment by cutting a path through the foliage. But she called the cops when he started to explain to her what invasive species were and how, if anything, it was a good thing Frank had done. And when the police arrived, they confiscated his rusty pair of loppers while moving him on because they said there had been mention of him threatening someone with a pair of loppers while waving them in someone’s face. Frank isn’t completely sure but he thought they were by his side the whole time.**

**Frank remembers feeling sad. Those loppers were his last possession he still owned, from when he moved out of his rental condo a day before he would have been evicted. Even if they were not worth any money to a pawnbroker, and technically not his possession but the property of Edward’s company. Then, Frank sees a discarded newspaper, with Dave’s picture next to someone else’s. Frank learns that a guy named George has been elected, and has already begun the push to withdraw funding for Dave’s ‘Developer Society’ as he calls it.** 

**George promises to bring true reform and finally fix the environment, the article states in a tone that is completely neutral and, Frank thinks, suspiciously careful to avoid comparing George’s promises with that of his predecessor.**

**Frank shares his conspiracy theory with a guy who stopped to throw a toonie in his hat, as he sat leaning against a brick wall reading the paper. The guy says he thinks Frank is reading too much into it, and mentions George drives the new model Volt that just came out. He adds that George has already switched the riding’s office coffee machines to dispense paper based stirrers, instead of plastic ones. “On day 1”, he says as parting farewell, walking away.**

**By complete coincidence, the next day Frank learns that George also collects the recyclable beverage containers from the riding office, and donates them to the homeless to sell. Frank was able to afford a six-pack of beer and a pack of smokes after adding his morning haul and the toonie from yesterday. Frank admits, with a hint of regret, as he sips a beer, that George is a pretty good guy.**

**The next day, Frank seeks out a newspaper, and learns that a special interest group has published a damning report into George’s planned cutbacks based on evidence provided by a subcontractor.**  **Frank learns that Dave had tapped Edward to be the part time subcontractor at a very nice wage, to do the field work at the same job Frank had applied for. Frank already knows Edward had the same qualifications as Frank.**

**A few days later Frank sees a picture of Edward and George shaking hands on the cover of a newspaper in the stand. He takes several copies of the free daily newspaper, but does not read the article, as the picture did not generate any interest in Frank to do so. He discards the covers of the newspaper in the bin at his park, as he has learned colour ink seems to cause an itchy reaction when used as toilet paper.** 

**Frank was not as careful today as he usually is. He did not notice that there was a guy out walking his dog, who had consequently observed Frank discard his newspaper covers, and then enter into the blackberry thicket, looking very homeless as he did so.**

**A gust of wind blows the papers back out of the bin. Like the flapping of a butterfly’s wings, this act of God causing a homeless man to litter, motivates Henry - the man walking his dog - to do his own small part for the environment. He places a phone call from his cell phone, as the newspaper covers blow by him, kicking one away that tangles on his shoe. The call connects with his local police, at the central dispatch call-center that handles all the local police forces in the city.** 

**Incident number received and noted in his phone, Henry pauses to pick up some of his dog’s droppings in a plastic glove made with 100% biodegradable material. Henry gingerly unrolls the glove, places it and its contents in the bin, and walks back to his rental unit, smiling as he reflects on how he still has the spark of the environmental activist in himself, even if he doesn’t go on strike these days.**","Aboriginal Coalition to End Homelessness, Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , Community Plan to End Homelessness , Evict, Evicted, Eviction, Makola Housing Society , Person experiencing homelessness , Service provider , Sooke Transition House Society",0,False,38.46153846153847

Either they just came to island, or are just here temporarily before they move on to better things or are moving out soon.
I could look past the non existent healthcare since thankfully at my age I don't necessarily need a family doctor. Rent is absolutely insane like without any fundamental logic insane. Buying a property is completely out of the question unless you make 250k or something.
5 of my friends recently moved off the island permanently. And I am joining that list too. I am lucky enough to have remote work and I am allowed to work anywhere from Canada. So the insane rent, high gas and grocery prices etc have started to hurt now.
Victoria has decent nightlife, amazing young crowd, plenty of activities to do, no matter what your interests might be.

VictoriaBC,TheFarSea,"B.C. considers cap on rent increases as inflation-fighting tool (From today's Globe and Mail).

The B.C. government is considering a suppression of residential rent increases in 2023 as tenants face the prospect of outsized rent hikes that aggravate inflation troubles.

David Eby, Attorney-General and Minister Responsible for Housing, said British Columbia is weighing various options, ranging from a rent freeze to using the standard formula for annual increases, which is tied to inflation. Like many provinces, B.C. froze rents early in the COVID-19 pandemic, a move that expired at the end of 2021.

Mr. Eby said a decision for 2023 would be made before the end of July.

“I know that a lot of landlords are facing increased costs around maintaining their buildings and staffing and this kind of thing. But we also know that tenants are incredibly vulnerable,” Mr. Eby said, noting that “a significant rent hike could undo a lot of the work we’re trying to do around homelessness. So we’re trying to balance those interests.”

Under the existing formula, rent increases in B.C. are based on the province’s average annual inflation from August through July, prior to the year in which the hikes take effect. In 2022, the maximum allowable rent increase for most tenants was 1.5 per cent, a reflection of the tepid inflation that was seen from August, 2020, to July, 2021.

More recently, inflation has surged to multidecade highs. Statistics Canada reported last week that the annual inflation rate hit 7.7 per cent in May, the highest since 1983. In B.C., the inflation rate was 8.1 per cent. If that holds for two more months, B.C.’s maximum allowable rent increase in 2023 would be 5.4 per cent, adding to cost-of-living pressures. It would also be the largest provincial rent hike since at least 2004.

B.C. had nearly 600,000 tenant households in 2016, based on census results. (The 2021 census results for housing will be published in September.) About 43 per cent of those households were spending 30 per cent or more of their income on shelter costs – above what the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) considers affordable.

Across the country, there is a patchwork of policies on residential rent increases. In Nova Scotia, which normally doesn’t have rent control, there is a temporary annual limit of 2 per cent on hikes until the end of 2023, brought in to help tenants during the pandemic. In Ontario, rent increases are tied to inflation for most units, though there’s an annual cap of 2.5 per cent. Some provinces, such as Alberta, do not have rent control.

Even with limits in many jurisdictions, rental costs are accelerating. Rents have risen 4.4 per cent nationwide over the past year, among the largest increases seen since 1990, according to Statscan’s consumer price index, the main gauge of inflation. Following decades of scant construction, apartment vacancies are meagre in parts of Canada and when units are vacated and become available, landlords in most provinces can set rates where they wish.

The Vancouver area is among the most expensive rental markets in the country. The average monthly rent for a two-bedroom condo in the region was about $2,500 in 2021, according to CMHC. If rents were to increase by 5.4 per cent next year, those units would cost $135 more a month, or $1,620 over a full year.

Rents “are the largest single item that governments have direct control over,” said Ricardo Tranjan, a political economist with the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a think tank. “If the political will is there, it is low-hanging fruit in terms of mitigating the impact” of high inflation, he said.

Under New Democratic Party control, the B.C. government has previously moved to curb rental costs. Annual rent increases used to be based on inflation, plus an additional two percentage points. The B.C. NDP changed the formula so that it was based solely on inflation, starting in 2019.

Any further reduction in rent increases is likely to draw the ire of landlords, who are seeing their costs increase rapidly, too. Many homeowners are starting to renew their mortgages at significantly higher interest rates, while costs for home insurance, repairs and utilities have also surged.

“In the long term, rents need to keep up with the costs of providing rental housing,” said John Dickie, president of the Canadian Federation of Apartment Associations.

Mr. Dickie said rising interest rates and lower limits on rent increases could hinder the construction of purpose-built apartments. “We are certainly seeing that people are taking a very hard look at projects now,” he said.

Recent history has proven favourable. In the first quarter of 2022, there were more than 115,000 rental units under construction in Canada, the most since at least 1990, according to CMHC. Rock-bottom interest rates, strong population growth and priced-out homebuyers have drawn developers into rental housing.

Mr. Eby said he was sensitive to the cost pressures facing landlords. He noted that landlords can apply for larger rent increases when they make necessary home repairs, such as replacing a roof.

However, Mr. Eby said that “tenants are in a pretty precarious spot right now and they haven’t seen the benefit of the lift in the property market that landlords have.”","Aboriginal Coalition to End Homelessness, Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , Community Plan to End Homelessness , Low income, Low-income, Shelter, Temporary housing , Temporary shelter",1,True,0.0

Our plan was to take some bikes up from Seattle on a ferry then bike around Victoria, stopping at each of the city's fine breweries and maybe some pubs.  We were hoping to also get a bit of a taste at each brewery, however it appears that some of our planned stops don't actually have tasting rooms.

VictoriaBC,TheMoniker,"Earthquakes and older (pre-1972) wooden buildings. I'm hoping that someone here might have some relevant background in engineering or seismic upgrades and be able to answer a few questions I have about older wooden buildings.

I was looking at the report [1] commissioned by the City of Victoria that covers the impact of large earthquakes on the city's housing (and other areas). It lists older (i.e. pre-1972) three- and four-story multi-unit wooden buildings as being among those at risk of complete failure, where complete failure means anything from lateral displacement to total collapse.

Like many people in the city, I live in a unit in just such an older, four-storey wooden building, with multiple units (built according to the 1970 building code). It's also on the border between bedrock and clay, so I'm not sure about the ground beneath it. I'm curious what the risk of a building like mine actually collapsing during an earthquake is. Because the report doesn't present more granular, disaggregated data on the buildings within the category, separating wooden from unreinforced masonry, etc., I'm curious if there is anyone here with a relevant background who could provide more information. If the building I live in needs to be demolished after an earthquake, that's something I can insure against. If the building is a death trap that will bury me alive, that's a different story. (Obviously a site-specific assessment with modelling and borehole data, etc. is the way to determine this for sure, but that's beyond my means—or I'd already be living in a much newer building—and I'm looking more for general information, like, ""even if they aren't built on bedrock, 1960s wooden multistory buildings often need to be demolished after earthquakes, but they basically never totally collapse."") I did check the subreddit, but couldn't find anything on this. I'll list a few things that I did find in case they're of interest to someone else [2].

Also, I know that there are some things that cause particular concern for collapse, like soft-stories from tuck-under parking. I'm curious if having an above-ground concrete parking lot for the first floor (i.e. the entire first floor of the building being concrete, above ground and a parking area) makes a difference, one way or the other.

If you can help, thanks in advance!

Apparently, he was transferred to another location in order to protect him rather than reporting to police - AND - Sam has also allegedly been fighting civil suits from the victims of his son's Matthew Shwabe's child pornography charges?

He’s banned most Airbnb-style short-term rentals, eliminated single family zoning, quashed public rezoning hearings and redesigned community amenity funding — all in under a month. Plus, he’s taken significant stabs at making it easier to clear homeless encampments from public parks, and tweaked the residential tenancy branch.  
>  
>The scope and breadth of the change is extraordinary....All told, the half dozen or so bills set the NDP up to promise almost 300,000 new housing units. Some, like 16,000 units freed up by limiting Airbnb-style rentals to principal residences, will depend on how the market responds.

>""One of Eby’s largest reforms is still to come. He has billions set aside for a new BC Builds program in the spring.

I'm going to add some food for thought: the BC NDP have actually had a pretty limited term, despite the rhetoric from the opposition about ""seven years of NDP."" John Horgan overturned Christy Clark in July 2017, and had the SLIMMEST of minorities, having to be hamstrung by Andrew Weaver, who has proven himself a krank with his post-politics life.

Then, in 2020, mid-pandemic, Horgan got a majority. However you feel about that snap election, it was only then that the BCNDP really got power. And then, they had to ride out the last years of COVID-19, which was only declared over THIS YEAR.

Now, Eby's in charge post-Horgan, and we're really seeing what a BCNDP majority wants to do. And honestly? I'm all for it. I didn't vote for them in 2020. I'll say that.

But right now, they've got my vote for 2024. ","Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , BC Housing, Community Plan to End Homelessness , Encampment, Encampments, Peer Housing Support Program, Sooke Transition House Society",1,True,25.0
VictoriaBC,The_CaNerdian_,"Want Island Rail back? Write to your MLA and the Ministry of Transportation ASAP As the March 14 deadline imposed by Judge Barbara Fisher in **Snaw-Naw-As First Nation** vs. **The Attorney General of Canada and Island Corridor Foundation** looms, the final fate of if we will ever have good transportation on the Island is in the hands of the provincial government.

Why?

Because the highest estimate that has been raised in study after study on this corridor's restoration has NOT exceeded $1 billion. In 2020, it was pegged at about $730 million.

And we KNOW the province can afford $1 billion, because they were willing to throw that money out on a new Royal BC Museum, before public backlash. That was budgeted at $789 million.

So the money is there. Willpower is what's lacking. And the judge said it's up to the feds and the province to either fund it, or lose it: ""the appellant will be entitled to return to court to enforce its right of reversion if Canada does not approve funding for infrastructure improvements on the segment of the corridor that includes the SFN Reserve within 18 months.""

Folks, we need this rail service. The commute to the Westshore is only going to get worse. Private bus companies will NEVER fill the gap in transportation to Duncan, let alone to Nanaimo or Courtenay.

The Malahat flooded last year and we literally COULD NOT move people or goods on the Island. Adding a single lane to highways over and over costs BILLIONS in both construction and maintenance, and there is NO LAND TO BUILD ON.

Enough is enough. We need to put up or shut up. I'm writing to my MLA and the Ministry of Transportation and telling them they will either have my vote next election, or they will lose it to the BC Liberals because of this. It's that simple. I'd rather see the Island go BC Liberal than throw away our one chance to make the Island a reasonable place to get around.

\- they do door-knocking and talk to people  
\- they're concerned with making progress, instead of trying to take Victoria backwards  
\- they have a variety of experience, including community association work, business experience, and volunteerism  
\- more than anything, their platforms are among the most complete (except Loughton, get on that jeez), have firm plans that don't just push the buck to the province or feds, and are based on things that councillors actually do

I'll try and keep this as brief as I can, but I tend to ramble so bear with me. I'm a university student from Ottawa and I'm currently enrolled with a coop program for my school. As of now, I'm completing my first two of four (or five) work terms that I need to do in order to graduate, but I'm already looking around for a placement for my next work term.

Being from Ontario (which is arguably far from any coasts), I've always wanted to visit Victoria (heck, any of B.C. really) since of the two coasts, it's the one that fascinated me the most. I want to not only see the city but the ocean coast, The Rocky Mountains, and any other major tourist sites B.C has to offer.

Seeing as my next coop term is during the summer of 2015, I figured why not knock two birds with one stone, and try and find myself a placement in Victoria. The way I see it, the money I'll be making with the term will cover my living expenses and I'll have enough free time to visit the city.

The reason I'm posting here though is because I know next to nothing about what it's like to actually live in the city. Once I finish my post I'll be looking at the various threads linked in the side bar but I thought I'd ask for information before that.

Essentially, I'll gladly accept any sort of info. What do you recommend for housing in regards to pricing? Should I find myself an apartment, or should I find an advertisement on kijiji for a roommate? Is there a coop building for students that I can look into? What's the public transport like? Good, bad, expensive, should be avoided at all costs? Do you even know if there are any coop opportunities in Victoria, or are they located in a small suburb outside of the city?

- Dentist who attended Pacific Dental conference has passed away but was known and investigated/traced already and people were isolated - 32 cases can be traced directly/indirectly to PDC and all were told to isolate - all other assorted non-hands on physicians (dentists, physicians, nurses, chiro etc) have been told to cease all but emergency services.


- They are testing and contact tracing anyone that they cannot link to any other confirmed infected sources. International isolations with symptoms are assumed to be confirmed. This is to focus on community transmission cases or clusters and prioritize health care workers.


- Almost 30,000 tests have been completed and the backlog is cleared - Social distancing is important but so are social connections with each other.

Minister Dix:


- No part of the province is immune but the lower mainland is hit hardest.


- 3,867 total acute care beds and ⅔ beds are filled, and normally 103.5% are filled. Lots of space still it seems, but “preparing” for the worst to come


- 3,500 tests per day thru BCCDC - Numbers expected fully to rise more and more. No easy and short fix. Talks about “weeks and months” well into April


- “100% compliance from 100% of the people at 100% of the time.” in regards to the measures and orders in place.


QA Questions 1 thru 7:

Q1: How many healthcare workers have tested positive and what's the contingency in place?

A1, Henry: 55 health care workers involved in the long term care outbreaks. Plans to supplement staff in long term care facilities and to get staff to care for COVID patients in hospitals i.e. bringing back retired doctors/nurses. 

A1, Dix: more information forthcoming about plans in place to bring back health care workers from retirement. Crucial to protect healthcare workers in and out of workspaces (community transmission). 


Q2: Re: Douglas College issued a note saying a student in the library (presumptive case?) how concerned should people be?

A2, Henry: doesn’t know details on the case or example but if it's from Health Auth. it’s legitimate.


Q3: Re: Dentist death from PDC, is it confirmed linked to COVID? How concerned should we be?

A3, Henry: Unconfirmed at this point, will leave that to the coroner. Discression is due to privacy and will be up to the family of the deceased.


Q4: Re: Dentist again - is it confirmed? (didn’t hear the last question), is it included in COVID death numbers? How afraid should people be of dentists?

A4, Henry: Don’t know the cause of death, an investigation had been done, we know they were at the conference, leaving it to the coroner. All patients that saw a dentist that were confirmed later have been notified.


Q5: Re: death rate, numbers are skewed because of number delays (??) What can you tell us about the mortality rate in the province?

A5, Henry: 13 of 600 is high but we consider the 10 at Lynn Valley as one event. We don’t have evidence of deaths from community transmission. We do know how many are hospitalized and/or in ICU, that is reflective of community cases. Early recommendation was to hospitalize everyone with COVID, ala SARS, but BC is not hospitalizing mild cases (many cases have very mild illness) to limit health worker exposure. Later in the week there will be more modelling and data analysis (thurs or fri) on how things are going.


Q6: Any advice or comment on conceiving children or pregnancy? Should people look to homebirth?

A6, Henry: No evidence of sexual contact transmission. Can be shed in stool (lmao) but no evidence conception is related to COVID. Children/Womens Hospital looking closely at data, pregnant women don’t seem to be more susceptible and there isn’t data to support fetus transmission of COVID. Hospitals are still safest for births.


Q7: 59 in hosptial now, over 4,000 acute care beds, that is alarming as you are saying that's not enough, why are you building so much space?

A7, Henry: We can’t prevent transmission, trying to decrease transmission, but people are incubating. We want those incubations to come slowly, not all at once. VIHA and lower mainland community transmission is driving cases. Rapid increases in infection are seen throughout the world and hospitalizations have skyrocketed. Trying to slow and mitigate that as much as possible. Trying to get capacity ready ahead of time over the next weeks/months.

A7, Dix: not 4,000 - 3,866 available acute care beds which indicates necessary preparation. “The modelling prepared us for this.” “This is based on modelling.” People ask, do we have enough beds? That will matter how much people followed the orders made by Dr. Henry. “A more difficult situation is pretty much inevitable.”","Community Plan to End Homelessness , Healthcare ",0,True,0.0

We politely decline.

He follows us. ""There's 4 of you, and none of you can spare 50 cents?""


 ""No,"" we reiterate. 

""What if I beat you up,"" he says angrily, as he gets right up in my face. 

""If you touch me, I'll kick the shit out of you."" 

He starts losing it. 
Takes off his jacket. Gets ready to throw down. Lipping me, swearing, running his mouth. 

By this point, we've arrived outside our destination, Foo Noodles, which has a good 20 onlookers. 

I'm not going to put up with it. He's being aggressive, and he's followed us. 
""Do it. Try it man. There's a few dozen witnesses right here. You'll be in jail within the hour. And don't doubt me when I say, if you hit me, I'll kick your teeth down your throat. Walk away. WALK AWAY."" 

I walked towards the restaurant. 
He called me a punk. 
I turned around and said, ""You're a stupid homeless piece of shit."" 

He followed me into the restaurant. 
Started knocking things over. 

I just stared at him. He left, momentarily. 

When he returned, he was apologetic. 

For a moment, I thought, ""Maybe this guy has the capacity to think beyond a primal level.""

So I apologized in return. 

He asks if he's still a, ""homeless piece of shit,"" loud enough, so that everyone in the restaurant thinks I'm an asshole.

I see his game. Paint me as a villain, by only canvassing half the picture. 
I retorted, ""you followed us, AND threatened us, ANND became aggressive. I acted in a manner that was reasonable, given your actions."" 

He starts screaming insults again, once more acting very aggressive. I tell him he needs to leave, because he is making everyone in the restaurant uncomfortable, and a fool of himself to boot. 

I repeatedly ask onlookers to call the police. 

After throwing some chairs, he again leaves. They lock down the restaurant. He starts punching the restaurant windows, from the outside. Screaming. 

The cashier calls the cops. 
""He's here again... No, he's a serious threat this time.""

This continues on for 10 minutes or so, until the cops show up. 

As the squad car pulls in, I look at the man through the window, give him a little wave, and point to the officer. 

Buddy walks up to the cop, and is arrested immediately, no questions asked. 

Everyone in the restaurant is silent. 
A few people gave me words of support on their way out. 

After the fact, I realized I recognize the guy. He likes to hang out by the church at View and Blanschard. I've seen him harass others before.  Likely the same guy who tried his coercive panhandling tactics on some friends and I another time; luckily, my buddies were very large and intimidating.  

One of the cooks suggested that I may have handled the situation poorly, like I egged him on. 

No. What other recourse did we have? 

People like him need to be told off by someone, otherwise they're going to keep doing it.

Thanks to the staff who handled the situation well, and my apologies to the other patrons of Foo.

Throwaway account as I'm currently renting and don't want to make things awkward with my landlord. We can all appreciate how tough the rental market is! My family is looking to move to the westshore and we're strongly considering Royal Bay or Westhills. Two of the most important factors for us are a sense of community and schools. We have young kids who will be entering elementary school soon and we want to hear from other families in that area on what their experience has been with schools and just life in general, at various stages of their kids lives:

1. Did your young kids make friends in the area? Are you close with your neighbours? Did you integrate easily with the community?
2. For older kids (pre-teens and above) what do they do for fun? Do they ever complain about being bored or isolated from the rest of Victoria?

There's a good chance that we'll be relocating to Victoria so we're planning a week-long trip to Victoria in June to explore neighbourhoods and get a feel for where we might want to be located. We'd love the advice of locals on where we should concentrate our search.  We saw the housing links in the sidebar, thanks for keeping useful info there. That tells us how to find a place after we know what we should be looking for :-)

We're a late 30s/early 40s couple with our kids already off in college. We currently live part-time in the BC interior and part time on the prairies and we'd like to settle down to one household. Looking at renting for now. What are the  neighbourhoods to avoid versus ones to look at especially?

* We're summer sun lovers and I've read about the [rain shadow effect](http://www.olympicrainshadow.com/olympicrainshadowmap.html), are feeder communities like Sidney and Langford really that much different?
* We've usually lived in the downtown of wherever we are and like having a high walkability score, but don't mind driving if the scenery and cost savings are worth it (after downtown parking costs are considered) and if the traffic isn't awful along that particular road
* We're picky about having high build quality (at least not run-down) and don't want to maintain a yard, so a neighbourhood with lots of rental condos or apartments or decent suites-in-houses is ideal
* We're not looking for a lot of space (1bed+den is fine) but need 2 parking spots (truck and 2 touring motorcycles)
* We love good pubs and restaurants (and we typically like steakhouses), if there's at least 1 within walking distance it's a major bonus for a neighbourhood
* We have 2 indoors-only Devon Rex cats -- are there major rental management companies that are typically better at accommodating pets?
* We need very reliable and somewhat fast Internet (I often work from home)... are there places or feeder communities that aren't well serviced that we should avoid?

All British Columbians over the age of 12 are required to wear a mask or face covering while visiting indoor public spaces or face a $230 fine, according to the details of a provincial mask mandate released Tuesday afternoon.

“We’ve entered a second wave of COVID-19 in British Columbia and additional steps need to be taken to protect our health,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, in a statement.

“Last week, the PHO provided guidance that masks should be worn in all indoor public places. This new order under the EPA will ensure we have the tools necessary to enforce the mask mandate as recommended by the PHO.”

Under the Emergency Program Act (EPA), which applies for as long as BC remains under a state of emergency, masks are officially required to be worn by everyone over the age of 12 in many indoor public settings.

Some examples of these settings include:

* malls, shopping centres, coffee shops, and retail and grocery stores
* liquor and drug stores
* airports, city halls, libraries, community and recreation centres
* restaurants, pubs and bars
* places of public worship
* on public transportation, in a taxi or ride-sharing vehicle
* common areas of office buildings, court houses, hospitals and hotels
* common areas of sport and fitness centres when not engaged in physical activity
* common areas of post-secondary institutions and non-profit organizations.

**More orders are expected to be issued to mandate mask use in common areas of apartment buildings, condos and workplaces.**

According to the statement, this first order only covers situations in which strangers often interact.

For the purposes of this order, people are required to wear a mask or face covering that is medical or non-medical and covers both the nose and mouth. **Face shields do not count**.

Anyone who cannot wear a mask for a psychological, behavioural or health condition, or due to a physical, cognitive or mental impairment is exempt from this order, as is anyone who requires someone else to help them put on a mask.

Masks are not recommended for children under two years old. **For children between the ages of two and 12, mask use is recommended. Anyone above the age of 12 must wear a mask in the aforementioned settings.**

This order does allow people to temporarily remove their face covering to provide identification, consume food or drinks at an establishment that offers dine-in, while participating in a sport or fitness activity in a sport facility, or while receiving a personal or health service that requires the mask to be removed.

According to Farnworth, businesses are asked to review their COVID-19 safety plans to provide signage about the mandatory mask policy and let customers know about the new requirements.

“Of course, despite any range of efforts, some people will break the rules knowing full well what they’re doing,” the Minister added.

“These measures give police and other enforcement officials the tools to intervene with and penalize problematic individuals and groups.”

Anyone who does not comply with the new order, refuses to leave the space or responds with aggressive behaviour, even after being directed to follow the rules by an enforcement officer, could be subject to a **$230 fine.**

If violation tickets do not act as a deterrent, or in cases of particularly egregious contraventions or for repeat offenders, police can recommend charges in relation to the offence.

Those who wish to report non-compliance of this order can do so by calling their local government’s bylaw office.

Bylaw officers can then engage police or WorkSafeBC as required. Those who are unable to reach bylaw can contact their local police department using the non-emergency line.

Drugs in Victoria are running rampant (not talking about heroin or meth), most people I know in Victoria are active users of psychedelic drugs such as magic mushrooms or LSD even other drugs such as MDMA and ketamine. This is hugely frightening for me because I know (especially with last two) that a lot of the time its laced with something else or an entirely different drug itself which can be a huge risk to the user and my friends. I've brought up the idea of test kits to them and none of them are interested mostly because you have to order them online and they're pretty expensive.

I'm a volunteer with Our Place Society and I just came across the idea as a shower thought to host an Ask Me Anything with Our Place Society on this subreddit. After being an ""outsider"" to the organization and general homelessness in Victoria for a number of years and more recently meeting the awesome people who volunteer and do great work at Our Place Society, my perspective and knowledge on the current societal issues and organizational developments has changed and grown...

The idea that I'm proposing, if there is public interest, is to have a transparent QnA over Reddit with some of the leaders of Our Place Society, where anyone can simply ask them about the organization, the current developments within it, and what's happening in our beautiful city. 

As an outsider to the organization and still being relatively new, I understand some of the perspectives that many people have regarding the housing crisis, opioid epidemic, and general homelessness in Victoria. For me, I only saw it through the lens of seeing Tent Cities from the double decker 50 or 61 and by bike, with time I also sourced information from coworkers and the news. But after talking to the volunteers and leaders at Our Place, as well as some nurses working for similar organizations, my perspective broadened to the point where I myself can see the lack of publicly available information regarding pressing issues and the general topic of homelessness in Victoria. 

So if you're interested in having an ""Ask me Anything"" with some of the leaders and volunteers at Our Place Society, let me know in the poll and depending on the interest I may be able to convince a few of them to frequently check a formal reddit post on the topic (will also need to check with moderators about how to best organize this event).

VictoriaBC,Tronix5,"Uptown Douglas Corridor Plan For those of you not familiar with the Official Community Plan (OCP) for the Uptown Douglas Corridor, here is a link:

 [https://www.saanich.ca/EN/main/community/community-planning/centre-corridor-plans/uptown-douglas-corridor-plan.html](https://www.saanich.ca/EN/main/community/community-planning/centre-corridor-plans/uptown-douglas-corridor-plan.html) 

They are planning to develop it into something of a downtown Saanich over the next 20 years as they expect population in the area to double by 2038. This clearly means densification is required in the area, as the plan outlines.

I own a detached home in the area, and have for the most part always envisioned it as a home I'd be in for a very long time. With that being said, some of my plans include renovations and upgrades. However, given this plan, it kind of changes my perspective of what sort of upgrades I want to do to my house given that a developer could be knocking at the door anytime looking to buy my property and level my house.

My question is, does anyone have experience of living in an area that has a very aggressive plan for growth? If so, how quickly did these changes start occurring once the OCP was in place? I feel like it could be a good issue to have if a developer was wanting the land, as the valuation of the land is always higher to a developer. Also would be interested to hear about peoples experiences when it comes to developers wanting to buy their property and their neighbours property as well.

Really the dilemma for me is I don't really feel like sitting in a construction zone for the next 20 years. I also don't want to invest in renovations if the property is only going to be purchased and torn down. Lastly, I don't want to sell as if a developer does come knocking, the price I'd be able to sell for would be significantly higher.","Community Plan to End Homelessness , Lived Experience",0,True,0.0

VictoriaBC,TryptamineGhosts,"Beautiful, simple acts of human decency Dear Victoria redditors,

I witnessed something last night that brought many tears to my eyes: a simple act of love and kindness. 

An elderly gent pushing a walker comes along while I'm waiting for someone outside a restaurant where I'd just eaten. He's homeless, and what I suppose are the better part of his worldly possessions are attached by various means to the walker frame. The server who'd waited my table walks out and greets him by name, smiles, asks about his day and his health. She asks him what kind of sauce he'd like to have on the food she'll be bringing out to him. He thanks her, makes his request, and mentions that he'll need to use the bathroom. She invites him to do so, and tells him that he can wait inside and sit down on the bench in their foyer.

Every time I read something on this subreddit about homelessness, it seems there's an inevitable surge of angry people or angry words directed towards ""the homeless"" as though they were a simple, homogenous group. There's a popular sentiment that those who are unhoused are deserving of that status.

The man who I saw might be a drug addict, or a criminal, I don't know because I didn't take the time to ask, and I can't know based on what I saw. What I do know is that he's a fellow human who needs something to eat, and an occasional bathroom break and a rest, just like me. And when he approached an establishment that had the ability to help him fulfill those needs, he was received with kindness and dignity, greeted by name, and welcomed inside to share in their hospitality. I was deeply moved by this, and I wanted to share my story with all of you in hopes that it'll spark some recognition that we have the wherewithal to provide our fellow humans with a hot meal and a place to rest a minute if we can first recognize our shared humanity. Love begets love, no matter someone's social status. We spend a lot of time seeking big money, big drama solutions to big systemic problems.

1 - What would be the cheapest area to rent a student room in a shared House / Apartment outside Victoria’s downtown, I’ve heard about surrounding places like “Saanich” or “Oak bay” but I don’t have a clue. I’ve seen many places on Kijiji with prices of 550-650 which happens to be my budget, and it's cool (I don’t really care about taking 30 minutes to travel on the bus every day since where I live we’re used to taking 40min-2 hours one every day, yes I know it’s crazy hahahahaha xD)

2 - I’m thinking on study “Hospitality management” at Camosun College. If we talk about the “pre-covid” daily life, do you think the Hospitality/Tourism industry is a good labour market in Victoria? Based on your local perspective would you say It’s strong enough to find a Job classified NOC B after graduation?

3 - I’ve heard that there are many “Thrift stores” and “Banks of food” that can help you to save money, are these institutions a good chance to do so? Or I’d better not bank on them as an option?

4 - Is it difficult to find a part-time job as an international student when you live in Victoria? Does it take too long to get one? I feel My English is not terrible but isn't really good as well.

My landlord texted me on July 31st telling me I have to move out by September 1st because he has other people moving in that want the entire house.

I am aware that he is supposed to give me two months notice via a written form from the RTB and not a text. I have informed him of this and he hasn't done anything about it. He is the type that thinks the rules don't apply to him (enters the house without notice, sometimes late at night etc. Leaves the doors open too!) so I doubt he will ever give me written notice.

My question is what can I do if he fails to give me notice?

I have found another place to live and am moving out at the end of the month anyways. Am I able to file a dispute and have him compensate me the 12 months of rent because he has failed to serve me notice AND he does not intend to use the property in good faith (kicking me out to move someone in that will pay more etc)?

This morning (not the first time) I was woken up to this lady taking her dog out to use the bathroom which she allows to run off leash up the road, and then she runs after it everytime yelling at it to return to her at the top of her lungs at around 2am. Once she eventually catches it she then walks back with it basically talking to it like it's a toddler still at the top of her lungs knowing full well there are tons of apartments surrounding her so it just echos the entire time. This is a daily occurrence during the day which I am fine with, but it's not the first time she has woken us up doing this and I'm losing quite a bit of sleep because of this.

VictoriaBC,VanIslandlurker,"My voting list for SD61 Trustees Hello fellow Victorians. The goal of this post is to help inform fellow voters about the SD61 Trustee candidates and to share who I am voting for and why I think they are worth supporting. 

Background about me: I have a child in Grade 4 at an SD61 Elementary School and I’m in the 4th year of being the Chair of the Parent’s Advisory Council at that school. In that role, I’ve attended several SD61 board meetings over the last 4 years. I’ve also attended VCPAC meetings (Victoria Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils). I would say I am very well informed on this topic and the candidates. 

Here’s who I plan to vote for:

Rob Paynter
Nicole Duncan
Ann whiteaker
Karin Kwan
Angela Carmichael
Cindy Bedi Ralph
Mavis David
Esther Calo
Emily Mahbobi 

I’m supporting the incumbents Rob Paynter, Ann Whiteaker and Nicole Duncan because they have been strong advocates for all students and have attempted to be the voices of reason amongst all the dysfunction of the current board. 

Next up are awesome parent advocates I’ve worked with either through VCPAC or groups to save music education or trying to prevent budget cuts: Karin Kwan, Angela Carmichael and Cindy Bedi Ralph.

Mavis David is an indigenous candidate and it’s extremely important to have her voice at the board table. There’s been a lot of damage done by the current board and there’s a lot of work that needs to be done by the next board to ensure that the needs of indigenous learners are met and that proper consultation takes place with the 4 houses. 

Finally, I will be supporting Esther Calo and Emily Mahbobi. I’m supporting these two largely bc I like their answers in the detailed questionnaire on the VCPAC website.

Is it social profiling to give a fine or ticket to a homeless man for not having a helmet on his bike?

Is he a liability to the taxpayers because he does not have a helmet? Comparable to say, not wearing one's seatbelt?

Helmets save lives, but winos drive at a slow pace - meaning they are seemingly safer bike drivers than your typical fast paced bike rider - like myself.

I am not inconvenienced by the helmet law, I love my helmet, and remember how many times I had my bike helmets stolen, whether from my locker at the YMCA, or on the bike - learned not to do that pretty quick - or when you give your helmet to a ""friend"" to hold for a second, and they take off with the shit.

Either way, my helmet is great, and I would not feel the same biking without it.

That aside, there still remains the issue that homeless people cannot afford a helmet.

Why don't we give them a helmet, instead of fining them to buy one?

Side note - also seen hobos biking down Douglas with the helmet on - but side straps not done up - do up the helmet - you look like you have Goofy's ears from Disney.

So a couple of questions:
1) should we fine homeless people for not having bike helmets - can we have an income based system? as ridiculous as it sounds...

2) should it be legal for police to be permitted to search a homeless person, for not having a bike helmet?",Person experiencing homelessness ,0,False,3.4482758620689653

VictoriaBC,VicPDCanada,"""Virtual Kidnapping"" of Chinese woman leads to warning to our Chinese community Investigators are warning the public, specifically members of our Chinese community, as they continue investigating an elaborate extortion scheme known as a “virtual kidnapping.”

Officers were called to investigate after a young woman was reported missing by her roommate on the evening of Monday, May 14th. As the investigation progressed, investigators learned of evidence pointing to the young woman being held against her will. After additional investigative efforts, a search for the missing young woman was successful in locating her that night. She was physically unharmed and appears to have been victimized, along with her family, in a virtual kidnapping.

In addition to the police resources utilized, and the emotional cost to the victim and her family, the suspects were able to take a significant amount of money from the family before the extortion was uncovered.

What is a virtual kidnapping?

There have been several reports of these types of incidents in Vancouver and the Lower Mainland, including two in recent weeks.

The perpetrators of these crimes often target young women who are in their early 20s, from mainland China and are in Canada studying on a student visa. The victim receives a phone call, often from a number that appears to be from the Chinese Consulate. The victim is then informed that there is either a warrant for her arrest in China, or that the Chinese police need her help with an investigation. As part of the extortion, the suspects eventually convince the victim to make fake videos indicating that she has been kidnapped or is the victim of a crime.

These videos are then sent to the victim’s family members, who are, in turn, extorted for money. The victim is then told to go to a motel or a short-term rental to hide from Canadian police.

What can you do?

If you are contacted by someone claiming to be from the Chinese Consulate or the Chinese Police who ask you to participate in a similar occurrence, you are asked to call our non-emergency line at (250) 995-7654, or your local police.

Speak with students and visitors in your community from mainlaind China about these extortions and encourage them to contact police if they feel unsafe or are contacted by people claiming to be the Chinese authorities who are asking them to pretend to be the victim of a crime.

WARNING | EXTORTIONS TARGETING CHINESE STUDENTS

The Chinese Police or government cannot arrest you in Canada.
All policing related contact from the Chinese government will be through local police.

Canadian or Chinese authorities will not ask you to destroy a phone or to take photos or videos of yourself pretending to be the victim of a crime.

If you are contacted by someone claiming to be the Chinese police and they ask you to be of assist and investigation by pretending to be the victim of a crime, call (250) 995-7654 for assistance (even if they tell you not to).

The Victoria Police Department is here to help you. If you feel unsafe or threatened, please call us either by dialing 911 or (250) 995-7654.

When someone sees a backpack, laptop bag, GPS mount or a power plug it indicates there may be a pricey possession such as a tablet, laptop, GPS unit, MP3 player or a cell phone available to steal.

VictoriaBC,VicPDCanada,"A piece of our history and Victoria's history | Remembering Fallen Constable John Curry VicPD Officers are remembering one of our own today. Constable John Curry’s End of Watch was Monday, February 29th, 1864.

155 years ago, 24 year-old Constable John Curry found himself testifying at a “Coroner’s Inquisition” regarding the death of a young First Nations boy. The inquisition was held at the Boomerang Saloon. Constable Curry himself be the subject of the very next Coroner’s Inquisition in Victoria at the saloon; having been shot and killed in the course of his duties late on Monday, February 29th, 1864.

&#x200B;

[Victoria Gaol is the \\""castle\\"" type building in the upper right hand corner, the Boomerang Saloon is the building in the lower left hand corner. ](https://preview.redd.it/oiqecggd9jj21.jpg?width=299&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=466de81da37b3354c4697ffc52aed83a3a7c4f31)

Constable John Curry had left his native Durham, England and joined the Victoria Police Department in February of 1863. As was the norm, Constables at the time lived in the police barracks and carried out their duties without the use of firearms unless specifically issued by the Sergeant-in-Charge. Patrol duty in town did not merit the issuing of firearms while “specials and officers patrolling the outskirts, where there are burglars and dangerous characters, are provided with them.”

Constable Curry was on duty during the night of the 29th and was on foot in the area of the Store Street. He was in possession of information that a “break-in” had been planned somewhere in the area and had been instructed to keep a watch for it.  Not in uniform, Constable Curry carried out his duties that night until he heard the noise of a commotion at what was at the time Mrs. Copperman’s Store, located on the north side of lower Johnson Street. Unbeknownst to him, night watchman Thomas Edmund Barrett had been attacked at his post at Mrs. Copperman’s Store after discovering an open door and realizing that a break-in had indeed occurred. Barrett had fought with two men inside and had been cut severely on the head.

After fighting off two assailants, Barrett rushed towards the rear of the building which was both the store and Mrs. Copperman’s residence, thinking that his attackers were fleeing out the back. The north side of the buildings and property ended at the Johnson Street Ravine that ran down towards the water where the suspects could easily have fled. In the confusion and darkness, Barrett met with Constable Curry who, likely hearing the commotion, had come up from the ravine. Barrett saw a figure charging through the darkness and in his mind, it was one of his attackers come back to continue the assault. Armed with a pistol, Barrett called out “stand back, or I’ll shoot!”

Barrett fired once, hitting Curry in the right side. Barrett frantically blew his whistle and on the attendance of yet another officer, examined the fallen man, discovering that it was Constable Curry. Curry was propped up against an adjacent building and was asked if he had hit Barrett. He replied, “I struck no man.”

He died at the scene.

Constable John Curry was the second official police officer in the Victoria Police Department’s history as well as the second officer in B.C. to lose his life while in the service of others. He had served barely a year.

The Coroner’s Inquisition into John Curry’s death of came back with a verdict of Justifiable Homicide in that Barrett “was an officer paid to protect property and not to run” and recommended in future that police use a system of special passwords to prevent such tragedies.

Constable John Curry’s grave is located in the “Old Burying Grounds”, now known as Pioneer Park, although the exact site has long been lost. He had no family in Canada and his family in England has never been located.

Patrol officers are asking for your help as they work to locate a bike theft suspect and return an elderly man’s brand new electric-assist bike.

Patrol officers were called to a multi-unit residential building in the 600-block of Toronto Street on January 15th, 2019 for a report of a theft, with the theft and suspect caught on video. The victim, an elderly Victoria man, reported that he had purchased the electric-assist bike the previous day. The man reported that, due to his age, the electric-assist bicycle is essential to his ability to get around the city.

Staff reported that when her order did not contain a tomato, the suspect became verbally abusive with staff. When a staff member offered to refund her money, the woman threw several items at the employee, striking him. An unidentified male then intervened, and appeared to attempt to de-escalate the incident. This was unsuccessful and the woman then struck one of the ordering kiosks several times. The kiosk was knocked out of order. The woman and the man with her then left the restaurant. The employee was not physically injured.

Investigators are working the BC Coroners Service in the investigation into a fatal incident involving a garbage truck this morning.

Officers were called to the 1300-block of Vancouver Street just after 6 a.m. for a report of an incident involving a garbage truck. When officers arrived, they discovered a man suffering from life-threatening injuries. Officers remained with the man until Victoria Fire Department Firefighters and BC Emergency Health Services Paramedics arrived and took over care. The man was rushed to hospital but succumbed to his injuries.

The initial investigation indicates that the man was in the box area of the garbage truck when he was injured and may have been in a dumpster that was picked up by the truck. The driver of the vehicle was not physically injured but is being offered support.

While the man has now been identified by investigators, his next of kin have not been notified.

This incident remains under investigation.

The recovered suspected stolen bicycles are being posted daily to the local [Victoria Stolen Bicycle Avengers Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/94983981282/). Officers believe that some bicycles have been recovered without their rightful owners knowing that they are missing. If you store your bicycle in a storage locker, officers are asking you to check on it.

The large number of bicycles seized and large numbers of bicycles reported stolen underscores the need for projects like this. VicPD launched our Bike Registry to help combat rising numbers of stolen bicycle reports and low returns of seized bicycles.  You can learn more about our bike registry and download your registration form today by visiting [vicpd.ca/bike](https://vicpd.ca/bike).

VictoriaBC,VicPDCanada,"GVERT, Community Services Division Arrest Barricaded Man Without Injury [File: 19-4272](https://twitter.com/hashtag/F194272?src=hash)

Officers from the Greater Victoria Emergency Response Team (GVERT) and our Community Services Division took a man, wanted on a warrant for his arrest, into custody this morning after he barricaded himself inside a residence.

The man was arrested at a suite in a multi-unit residential building in the 300-block of Burnside Road just after 9:30 this morning. The man is barred from residing at the property by court-ordered conditions stemming from an assault conviction. Patrol officers originally contacted him earlier this week when he breached his court-ordered conditions. Patrol officers negotiated with the man to give himself up peaceably over the last several days, speaking with him on multiple occasions. When the man ultimately refused, Community Services Division officers took on the file and continued to work to arrest him on his warrant for violating his court-ordered conditions. 

The man continued to refuse to give himself up and barricaded himself in the suite. Crisis negotiators and additional members of the Greater Victoria Emergency Response Team were called in to assist and worked for a number of hours to take the man into custody. When the man again refused, officers warned him that CS gas would be used to extract him from the suite. The man continued to refuse to surrender himself. GVERT officers then deployed CS gas, which prompted the man to give himself up to police officers. He was taken into custody without further incident and transported back to cells in the GVERT Rescue Vehicle for decontamination. 

The man is being held for court for four offences relating to multiple breaches of court-ordered conditions. Community Services Division officers are also working to ensure that the man is connected to supportive resources.

Erin Glazier rode alongside other members of media and police officers in the 2012 Tour de Rock in an effort to raise funds to send children with cancer to Camp Goodtimes. The Tour de Rock is a yearly partnership between media, police officers and other first responders  and sees riders ride the Vancouver Island as they raise funds.

Each year, the bikes the riders use are temporarily donated by Trek bikes. Riders have the option to purchase their bikes once their Tour is complete. The loss of the bike isn’t only a financial hit for the local triathlete. It comes with irreplaceable memories of her time on the Tour de Rock.

The bike was stolen from the 500-block of Fisgard Street in the early morning hours of August 1st, 2018. Nearby surveillance video caught a suspect on the bike. The suspect is described as a male standing approximately five feet, 10 inches tall, with a medium build and shaggy, dark brown hair. He was wearing a scarf, a long sleeve grey sweater and dark pants.

VictoriaBC,VicPDCanada,"Investigators have released a photo of the second longboard stolen in that playground robbery that left a youth with potentially life-threatening injuries last week Officers were called to the playground in the 3100-block of Alder Street just before 9 p.m. on Tuesday, May 1st where they discovered the victim nearby. The victim, a male youth, reported that he and a friend were in the playground when two other males unknown to them approached and took their longboards. When the victim approached the two males who had taken their longboards, he was assaulted with a weapon. 
 
The unprovoked assault left the male youth with non-life-threatening, but potentially life-altering injuries. He remains in treatment for his injuries. The two other males then left the scene with the stolen longboards.
 
The suspects are described as two Aboriginal male youths, approximately 15 and 16 years old. Both were described as being short, standing about 5’3” tall and of average build. One of the suspects was wearing a red hat at the time of the incident. Our investigators continue to search for these suspects.

A photograph of the second longboard that was taken by the suspects was released today. This longboard is described as an arrow-head shaped board, with a wood-grain patina. The board has hand-written lettering near the front wheels on top and a distinctive “49” sticker on the wheels near the bottom. The board also had thick yellow wheels. A photograph of the board is below.

Unfortunately, there's a great deal of misinformation about policing in Victoria and Esquimalt, crime rates, calls, etc. Much of it is being shared widely today in advance of the City of Victoria's [budget consultation](https://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/city/city-budget.html), which takes place online and in-person today. Here's the op-ed and the actual numbers.

**TLDR:** **From 2013-2017 - property crime is up 13.1%, violent crime is up 11.8%. Saanich and Oak Bay's Crime Severity Index are 30-40. Victoria's Crime Severity Index is 114.**

**Victoria isn't ""the most heavily policed"" region in Canada. Policing makes up 22% of the City of Victoria budget, compared to 22% in Saanich, 23% in New Westminster and 26% in Abbotsford.**

&#x200B;

# ""Del Manak: Decisions about policing in Victoria must use the best evidence

Re: “How much for policing? A daunting challenge,” comment, Jan. 13.

Stan Bartlett raised a number of very important points in his opinion piece on the cost of policing in this region. Many of Bartlett’s points, such as the need to continue to pursue efficiencies and explore the amalgamation of policing services, are ones that I am glad he raised and are ones that, incidentally, I wholeheartedly endorse.

Other points, however, require some clarification.

VicPD has 243 officers, not 233. And while that correction might be interpreted as only reinforcing the argument that Victoria and Esquimalt are “overpoliced,” the data suggest otherwise. When factors such as call load per officer, response times and the unique concentration of issues that downtown Victoria bears for the entire region are taken into account, you get a more balanced picture of the reality that VicPD’s officers face.

And that leads me to crime rates. Bartlett’s figures paint the picture of crime rates falling all over the region, the province and Canada.

The good news is that he is correct, generally speaking.

The bad news is that this is not the case for Victoria and Esquimalt, which are the two communities VicPD serves.

From 2013 to 2017 (the last year for which Statistics Canada data are available), property crime in Victoria and Esquimalt climbed 13.1 per cent. Violent crime was up 11.8 per cent over that same period.

The much-quoted Crime Severity Index, which measures the number of crimes and their seriousness, tells a similar story. While neighbouring communities such as Saanich and Oak Bay saw CSI values in the 30 to 40 range in 2017, the CSI for Victoria and Esquimalt was 114. That is higher than Abbotsford and Vancouver.

Speaking of comparisons with neighbouring communities, Bartlett’s comparison of VicPD’s budget as a percentage of municipal operating costs is off by a fair bit. Municipalities vary in their treatment of certain items, such as traffic-fine revenue and cost recoveries from other municipalities. Other items such as utility services, capital and debt vary significantly in size and cost between municipalities and should not be included in comparing costs as a percentage of operations.

A more reliable comparison would be that of net police expenditures as a percentage of general operating budget, excluding utilities, capital and debt. While Bartlett is correct that VicPD’s budget for providing policing in Victoria is 22 per cent of the City of Victoria’s general operating budget, this is the same as in Saanich (22 per cent) and less than for the other police services he highlighted, New Westminster (23 per cent) and Abbotsford (26 per cent), in an “apples to apples” comparison.

VicPD has not had a single permanent officer added to our strength in eight years, a period that has seen significant growth in the population of our jurisdiction and the region as a whole. Our officers are bearing the brunt of this growing gap every day and every night, and that story is being told, unfortunately, through the increase in operational stress injuries, both physical and mental, among our men and women.

I welcome and encourage a meaningful conversation about police resourcing in our part of the world. I would only encourage that it be based on fact and evidence, so we can all make the best decisions possible.

VictoriaBC,VicPDCanada,"Luck Runs Out For Lottery Ticket Theft Suspect File:  18-33711

A Victoria man is facing charges after investigators brought a series of lottery ticket thefts to a close.

Officers from our Crime Reduction Unit (CRU) and Strike Force (SF) were tasked with investigating a dozen lottery ticket thefts which had occurred in retail business in both Victoria and neighboring jurisdictions in recent weeks. In many of these incidents the suspect would distract the store clerk, reach behind the counter, and steal hundreds of dollars’ worth of lottery tickets.

Investigators identified a suspect. On July 31st,  officers observed the suspect enter a store in the 1600-block of Government Street.  A plain clothes officer entered the store and observed the suspect reach behind the counter and steal a number of lottery tickets.  The suspect fled and was arrested a short distance away. The stolen lottery tickets were recovered. 

Investigators later executed a search warrant in the 900-block of Humboldt Street and located further evidence of thefts, including a stolen scooter.

Mark Ewart is facing 3 counts of theft under $5000. Officers are working with investigators from the BC Lottery Corporation and the Gaming Policy and Enforcement Branch of the Ministry of Attorney General, and are anticipating additional charges. Officers are also working to reunite the stolen scooter with its rightful owner.

Brandon Wildman is described as a 38 year-old Caucasian man with a thin build, standing five feet, ten inches tall. Wildman is balding, but often shaves his head and sometimes has a trimmed moustache or beard. He may be using the alias of David Howden. Warrants have been used for Wildman’s arrest for alleged offences in which he was reported to have used “David Howden” as his alias. These warrants involve a series of investigations in which Wildman is allegedly responsible for theft and damage to short-term and roommate rental accommodations.

In addition to his warrants, Wildman is a person of interest in an investigation into damage to a short-term rental property in Victoria.

The property owner called police to report that she had rented her short-term rental to a man who, not only did not pay his rental fee, but had stolen many items from within and damaged the property. While the property owner often rents out her property using services which require verification, this time, a relative had posted the rental availability through a website that does not require verification. Despite her misgivings, the property owner agreed to rent the property to the man, despite not having met him, seen him in person, nor being able to independently verify his identity. Upon her return home, she discovered the thefts and the extensive damage.

The combined losses for this file are over $5000.

If you see Brandon Wildman, please call 911. If you have information about his whereabouts, please call (250) 995-7654, or Greater Victoria Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.

**Brandon Wildman is presumed innocent until proven guilty.**

Information for those renting short-term properties or looking for roommates

You can protect yourself by taking a few key steps when renting space:

* Do not rent your space to someone without meeting that person or, for those who use short-term rental services like AirBnB, only rent to approved, confirmed persons.
* For those renting to roommates - do not rent your space without receiving a damage deposit.
* Ensure your valuables are secured when renting your space to persons you do not know.

Officers were called to investigate after a woman reported a fraud attempt that involved persons claiming to be Chinese authorities. The woman reported that on July 11th, 2018 she received an automatic telephone call in “unaccented” Mandarin indicating the call was from the Chinese embassy and that she had a package waiting. After following a series of prompts, the woman was connected with a man who claimed he was in investigator with a specific Chinese authority and that the woman was implicated in a serious crime. Over the course of the next several hours the woman was prompted for personal and financial information under the guise of an ongoing investigation. The fraudsters went far enough to instruct the woman to Google the number for the authority that the man claimed he was from to confirm the number he was calling from. Investigators believe the caller had “spoofed” the number.  

Luckily, the woman spoke with a friend about the incident and during that conversation became suspicious. The two then called police and spoke with investigators. So far, it appears the woman has not suffered any financial losses, however much of her personal information has been compromised.

A Victoria man is facing over 50 recommended charges after being arrested as officers executed a search warrant at a downtown multi-residential facility last week. The investigation first began when an alert member of the community spotted the suspect trying door handles on vehicles and called our non-emergency line.

Officers with the Greater Victoria Emergency Response Team and our Community Services Division executed a search warrant at a multi-residential facility in the 800-block of Johnson Street just before 7 a.m. on Thursday, October 4th, 2018. Officers attended the suite to execute the warrant and found the door open and suspect inside. The search warrant came after several days’ investigation which linked the suspect to drug dealing. The suspect was arrested without incident and the suite searched.

Inside, officers located hundreds of items that they believe to be stolen. Drugs were also seized, including over 10 grams of cocaine, 7 grams of methamphetamine, 6 grams of marijuana, and over 20 grams of heroin/fentanyl. Over $25,000 in cash was also seized.

In addition, dozens of stolen pieces of personal identification were also located during the search. Officers have been able to connect some of these items with thefts from vehicles in both Victoria and Saanich. This portion of the investigation remains underway as officers work to locate and identify others whose personal identification has been recovered.

A gallery of these items are below. If you recognize these items you are asked to call our non-emergency line at (250) 995-7654 and ask to speak with the exhibit officer in this file, Cst. Eirik Feir.

“This suspect first came to our attention when an alert member of our community, who spotted the suspect trying door handles on vehicles back in 2017, called us,” Community Services Division Inspector Michael Brown said. “Similarly, at least two members of our community who called us to report that items had been stolen from their vehicles overnight have assisted our investigation by being able to tie this suspect to stolen property.”

While the best strategy to avoid having valuables or personal identification stolen from vehicles is to not leave them behind, reporting them stolen when thefts from vehicles do occur provides important information that supports our investigations.

The suspect, a Victoria man, faces over 50 charges including charges for trafficking, possession of stolen property, identify theft, possession of stolen identity documents and failure to comply with a probation order.

If you recognize any of the recovered items above or have information about these incidents, you are asked to call our non-emergency line at (250) 995-7654. To report what you know anonymously, please call Greater Victoria Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.

VictoriaBC,VicPDCanada,"Officers are recommending 30 charges - 29 against one man - after weapons & drugs were seized during a fraud investigation. A Victoria man remains in custody facing 29 recommended charges after Patrol officers arrested on him on Friday, May 18th for a fraud in Esquimalt and discovered that, in addition to being suspected in other frauds, he was carrying a cache of weapons and illegal drugs on his person.

Patrol officers were first called to a business in the 800-block of Esquimalt Road on Thursday, May 17th for a report of two men who had passed counterfeit currency. Officers recognized one of the suspects from the description and began to search for him and his accomplice.

The next day, Patrol officers were called to the 1500-block of Fort Street in Victoria at approximately 2:45 p.m. for a report of a two men who appeared to be taking off handcuffs. The description of one of these men matched that of one of the fraud suspects from the previous day’s file. Patrol officers searched the area, but did not locate the suspects.

An hour later, Patrol officers spotted the fraud suspects near the intersection of Douglas and Yates streets in downtown Victoria. They stopped the men to take them into custody. One of the men turned away from the officers and refused to show his hands. He then turned back towards the officers with a knife in his hand. An officer was able to safely disarm him and Patrol officers began to take him into custody. The man then began to fight with officers and OC spray was deployed to help take him into custody.

When this first man was searched, Patrol officers discovered that he was in possession of five knives, including a prohibited switchblade, an asp baton, bear spray, illegal drugs, a replica handgun and over $7,000 in counterfeit currency. Patrol officers have since linked this man to at least two additional fraud investigations. He was held in custody for court, with officers recommending 29 charges including six counts of possession of concealed weapons, five counts of fraud under $5,000, two counts of possession of a controlled substance, one count of possession of counterfeit currency, one count of possession of a prohibited weapon, eight counts of breach of probation and six counts of breach of recognizance. Patrol officers believe that the man may be involved in additional frauds involving counterfeit currency.

The second man was arrested for breaching his probation and released on a promise to appear.

VictoriaBC,VicPDCanada,"Officers, Citizens & A Reserve Constable Work Together To Arrest Wanted Man A man wanted for offences related to a violent home invasion that involved a firearm and knives was taken into custody last night thanks to the combined efforts of officers from our Community Services Division, Patrol Division, Investigative Services Division, K9, an off-duty Reserve Constable and citizen members of our community.

Just before 9 p.m. last night, Community Services Division officers,  working to augment the Patrol shift, spotted the wanted man in a vehicle in at the intersection of Cook and Bay Streets. Officers had been looking for the man for his alleged involvement in a violent home invasion that involved a firearm and knives. Officers followed the vehicle which then stopped nearby in the 900-block of Bay Street. The man exited the vehicle, and when verbally challenged by officers to stop, fled the scene.

Officers flooded the area and the man continued to flee when spotted. During the hour-long foot pursuit through the Quadra Village neighbourhood many citizens, including an off-duty Reserve Constable. provided officers searching for the wanted man with updates on his location. Much of this information proved vital to the man’s eventual arrest.

The wanted man was finally taken into custody an hour later in the 2300 block of Vancouver Street. At that time the wanted man fought with officers and PSD Diesel was deployed to assist in effecting the arrest.

The tricycle is described as customized light blue, three-wheeled tricycle with “white wall” style tires, a black seat and several small rusty spots. It’s a three-speed bike with the gears and brakes on the right hand side. There is a photograph of the tricycle below, however the white basket was recently removed.

VictoriaBC,VicPDCanada,"Patrol officers reunite stolen, unique motorcycle with owner File: 18-34018

Patrol officers were able to reunite a stolen, one-of-a-kind, custom motorcycle with its relieved owner after a day-long investigation.

At 8 a.m. on August 2nd, Patrol officers were called to a hotel in the 600-block of Courtney Street after a guest at the hotel stepped out of his hotel room to discover his unique, one-of-a-kind, custom motorcycle had been stolen. The man had spent a significant period of time restoring and customizing the “café racer” style bike and had journeyed to Vancouver Island for a motorcycle trip on this bike. Surveillance footage from the scene showed a man in a van stop and load the motorcycle into the back of the van and then depart.

Armed with this evidence, Patrol officers were able to track down the registered owner of the van, who indicated that he’d lent the van to his daughter. Officers then located the registered owner’s daughter, who in turn indicated a friend, a Victoria man, had taken it, presumably to run an errand.

Utilizing several investigative techniques, these Patrol officers were able to track down the Victoria man who had taken the motorcycle and locate it outside a shop in downtown Victoria at approximately 3:30 pm. Officers then called the owner of the motorcycle and reunited him with it. The owner noted that the motorcycle was already in the process of being dismantled. However, he was also extremely grateful for the resolve with which our officers investigated the file and insisted they pose for a photograph with him and his motorcycle.

VictoriaBC,VicPDCanada,"Police Officer Down training prepared our officers to save a man's life this morning  An Esquimalt man is recovering in hospital after VicPD Patrol officers were able to provide life-saving first aid through a technique taught in our recent Police Officer Down training.

Patrol officers were called to a multi-unit residence in the 700-block of Lampson Street in Esquimalt just after midnight this morning for a call of a man in distress. When they arrived, the patrol officers discovered the man suffering life-threatening injuries and in need of immediate first aid. The officers, who were recently trained in the application of tourniquets as part of this year’s Officer Down training, applied  two tourniquets and provided other life-saving first aid. 

VicPD’s Police Officer Down training was adopted from the Vancouver Police Department Police Officer Down training and was developed in-house by VicPD officers, including members who serve Patrol and the Greater Victoria Emergency Response Team to provide life-saving first aid to themselves or other officers. The training was first created by VPD and adapted by VicPD members with the assistance of Dr. Mark Vu who serves as VicPD’s Medical Director.  

“The nature of law enforcement exposes police members to potentially life threatening occupational injuries, and the Police Officer Down training program empowers officers with the skills and equipment to help themselves and other police officers who are injured in the line of duty,” VicPD Medical Director Dr. Mark Vu said.  “Occasionally, when appropriate, having police officers with these skills will also benefit the safety of the public that we serve. I am grateful for the expert, professional response from these officers earlier this morning that appears to have had a life-saving impact on a member of the public, and I sincerely wish that individual a speedy recovery. I also want to acknowledge our colleagues, paramedics with at BC Emergency Services ambulance and Esquimalt Fire Rescue for their roles in assisting this individual.”

The man was transported to hospital with potentially life-threatening injuries for treatment, where he remains.

Patrol officers are warning the public after a man received non-life-threatening injuries after being poked by a syringe located inside a hollow fence post.

Patrol officers were called to the 700-block of Yates Street in Victoria for a report that a man had been injured. When they arrived they met a man who reported that he had been poked by a syringe that was located inside a hollow fence post. Upon examination, Patrol officers discovered that the needle wedged within the hollow post such that it could cause harm to someone who inserted his or her fingers into the hollow space.

The man was offered medical attention and will follow up with medical support to determine the extent of his injuries. At this time they are considered by officers to be non-life-threatening. Images of the hollow post where the syringe was discovered are below.

Used syringes and sharps must be disposed of properly. While it is reasonable to expect to be able to enjoy our city without danger of being injured by a syringe, we have now had reports of used syringes placed in several inappropriate locations over the last year, and in some circumstances causing injuries. Patrol officers are reminding the public to know this risk is now in our community and to not place one’s hands where one’s eyes haven’t been. A visual inspection of a hollow space may save you from injury.

Because of the long thread and multitude of comments I wanted to follow up. 

I spoke with the School Liaison Officers today. Two of them confirmed that they attended the school as part of a series of stops that they were making notifying school administrators and officials about a series of indecent acts targeting young women in Saanich. This incidents have been the subject of a number of public [notifications and media releases](http://www.saanichpolice.ca/index.php/public-information/media-releases/1096-two-further-indecent-acts-reported) from Saanich Police. 

When I asked specific constable about his parking he said that his intention was to quickly get in and out as they had a number of schools, agencies and community resource centre to drop by, and the street was quite narrow so they were doing their best. He confirmed that neither officer who were there have children who attend that school.

It is always, always, *always* ok to question your public servants about what they are doing and why - particularly the police. However, I ask that when you do so question, you consider doing before leaping to conclusions about our intentions or actions. 

Personally, while I disagree with the conclusions that /u/numerolophile reached about our officers' actions when it came to parking like that, I fully support his choice and right to question our actions.

In the days before her retirement earlier this week, Cst. Brenda Kelly was presented with an Inspector’s Commendation by Deputy Chief Constable Jason Laidman during an informal ceremony. The citation marks Cst. Kelly’s actions during a violent 2017 call in which she displayed courage and professionalism and saved a woman’s life.

On March 9th, 2017, in the late afternoon, the Victoria Police Department’s Communications Centre received a 911 call from a distraught woman who could be heard over the open phone line screaming for help. The woman could be heard pleading with her husband to get off her and to stop the attack. It was clear to the Communications Centre staff that the woman was being violently assaulted and was unable to escape.

Cst. Brenda Kelly, working as a single-officer unit, responded to the scene “code three”. As the first officer to arrive on scene, she was met with a locked front door and a violent attack taking place inside the residence. With neither back-up nor a full understanding of what awaited her inside, the need to save the victim from further harm drove Cst. Kelly to  gain entry into the home. Cst. Kelly made her way into the residence. Without hesitation and with complete disregard for her own safety, Cst. Kelly began clearing her way through the house in search of the victim and suspect.

Cst. Kelly located the victim in a small main-floor bathroom. The suspect, a man of significant stature, was in the midst of a life-threatening attack on a woman. Cst. Kelly was able to take charge  of the suspect and bring the assault to an end. She  held the suspect at gun-point until back-up officers arrived to assist in completing the arrest.

The suspect was arrested for aggravated assault and was taken into custody. As a result of Cst. Kelly’s quick, calm, and decisive actions, the victim was saved from the life-threatening attack.

Brad Erickson was recognized for his assistance when discovering a woman in medical distress at his place of work on June 2nd, 2018. Not only did Brad provide CPR to the woman, but, once first responders arrived, he continued to provide information to investigating officers and support to his staff.

Archie Acosta, Brandon Racine, and Simarjit Singh were all recognized for an incident involving a violent suspect who fought with police after a short foot chase. One of the officers received non-life-threatening injuries in the incident, yet the three continued to both assist in the arrest and, once officers had gained control of the suspect, kept the gathering crowd safe. The suspect was charged in the incident and the officer recovered from her injuries.

Shane Craven was recognized for his role in coming to the aid of a coworker who was suddenly attacked by an armed, masked assailant. Shane intervened, and with the help of coworker Paul Salopree (who was unable to attend the ceremony), was able to halt the attack, detain the suspect, and keep others safe. The officers who nominated the men for the Civic Service Award remarked on the courage and awareness they displayed.

Phil Ruskowski was recognized not for an individual act, but for 18 years of services as a mechanic and vehicle safety inspector. He has provided the Victoria Police Department with post-collision mechanical inspections of vehicles for the past 18 years. With an average of 10 per year he has completed nearly 180 vehicle inspections for the Victoria Police Department.

VictoriaBC,VicPDCanada,"Since you asked...What happens when you report your bike stolen. After the theft of one of our police mountain bikes there has been a considerable conversation about our service to the communities of Victoria and Esquimalt regarding bike theft. I thought I’d take this opportunity to tell you exactly what happens with your report of a stolen bike.
 
So…say your bike is stolen and you decide to report it to us (thank you BTW…not everyone does). IF the report of the bike is something like ‘my blue bike was stolen’, then, as some of the comments allude to, no, we can’t do much. IF however, there is information such as a serial number, marks, dents, stickers, make, model, or other things that you could identify as well as a photograph if possible, that information is sent to an officer to start an initial investigation. You don’t have to have all of that info, but the more you have, the better of a chance we’ll have of locating it.
 
The initial investigation typically has the officer take a look around a few of the local haunts where we recover stolen bikes. The information is shared with his/her squad mates and the Focused Enforcement Team either through our internal intranet or hard copy photos. The serial number is also added to CPIC, so if anyone in another jurisdiction runs it, it will show up as stolen.
 
At times the officer will ask for the assistance of our public affairs section (us) to get pictures out for stolen bikes. We do that at the request of any investigating officer.
 
If the bike remains unrecovered over that officer’s shift, they write up a file on it. That file is diverted to an officer who reviews EVERY stolen or recovered (found) bike report. Sometimes there is a glitch in the matrix when someone enters a bike as ‘grey’ and really  it’s ‘blue’, or lists it as a MTB instead of a road bike…those things happen and that’s why Cst. Millard reviews every…single…file. A number of bikes have been reunited with their happy owners this way.  Cst. Millard also checks other property files in case of miss-labeling.
 
We also have a bike pickup program that our Reserve Constables manage.  If the bike is picked up and cannot be matched to a reported stolen bike, photos are sent to me and I post them on Used Victoria and Pinterest in hopes of reuniting them.
 
We do have a large amount of bikes with our property section. These are bikes that have either been stolen or abandoned and nobody has reported. They’re sad. Reporting your stolen bike helps. These bikes will eventually find their way to auction.
 
A list of several, convicted, bike thieves has also been compiled. We do often request the assistance of our undercover officers in Strike Force and the Crime Reduction Unit to look at these individuals if they can be identified in an area that has seen an increase in bike theft.
 
This is not to dismiss the concerns that have been put forward here, or on a number of Facebook pages. I’ll be collecting this information and forwarding it to our Senior Command team. The comments are your feelings about our customer service regarding bike theft. Good or bad, they deserve to be heard.
 
Bike theft is an issue we deal with every day, bike theft is on the rise in Victoria and Esquimalt, but bike theft is something we take care to look at. Have we always done everything we could to investigate bike thefts? Admittedly, other issues sometimes took priority. Are we putting more effort into it now? Yes.

VictoriaBC,VicPDCanada,"Special Victims Unit Searching For Additional Victims As Man Arrested For Multiple Sexual Assaults File: 17-25590

An Esquimalt man is in custody facing four charges of sexual assault following a year-long investigation into a series of historical sexual assaults. Special Victims Unit investigators believe that there are likely more victims.

Kit Wong, a 71-year-old Esquimalt man, faces four charges of sexual assault related to historical sexual assaults involving four women. Wong was working as an acupuncturist, massage therapist and practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine out of his home-based business in Esquimalt. Several of the incidents are reported to have occurred there between 2005 and 2006.

Wong previously served as an officer in the Canadian Armed Forces.  Although not a member of the medical staff, he practiced traditional Chinese medicine on service members.

Given Wong’s career with the Canadian military, his work as an instructor and practitioner of acupuncture, and traditional Chinese medicine during the time of the allegations, investigators believe that there could be more unidentified victims, both in the Esquimalt community and across Canada. Investigators believe these victims could include current and former serving members of the Canadian Armed Forces, current and former students of traditional Chinese medicine, as well as members of the wider community.

“These alleged sexual assaults left these women feeling powerless,” Special Victims Unit Detective Graeme Leblanc said. “Our investigation indicates that Kit Wong’s position in the Canadian Armed Forces and in the community left women hurt by this man, feeling as though they could not come forward.  It doesn’t matter who the suspect is. We will listen.”

If you are a victim or have information regarding Kit Wong that you would like to share with police, investigators are asking you to call our non-emergency line at (250) 995-7654. Alternatively, you can contact the Victoria Sexual Assault Centre at (250) 383-3232. If you are a serving member of the Canadian Armed Forces and need support you can contact the Sexual Misconduct Response Centre at 1-844-750-1678 or through your chain of command.

To report what you know anonymously, please call Greater Victoria Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477.

Our message to survivors of sexualized violence is that we believe you.  For resources, please visit [https://vicpd.ca/webelieveyou](https://vicpd.ca/webelieveyou)

Kit Wong is considered innocent until proven guilty.

VictoriaBC,VicPDCanada,"Statement from Chief Constable Del Manak: Update on 2019 Budget Request  

In recent weeks, it has become apparent that many members of the public are interested in the ongoing discussion regarding the Victoria and Esquimalt Police Board’s request for funding for the Victoria Police Department for 2019.  The fact that so many people have joined the conversation about the future of their community highlights that most of our citizens care deeply about where they live and what the future holds for Victoria and Esquimalt.

However, it has also become clear that there is some misinformation being shared regarding the role of the Victoria Police Department, the work of our officers, and our Board’s request for resources. 

This community update is intended to correct that misinformation and provide additional context so we can all make the best possible decisions about this important topic.  Below you will find some of the questions we have received recently along with the facts associated with each.

**Has VicPD increased staffing in recent years?**

VicPD has not had a single permanent police officer position added since 2010.  The two Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) officers added in 2016 are in place on a trial basis and are not permanently funded. 

In terms of civilian staff, VicPD added seven civilian positions between 2010 and 2017.  These positions provided much-needed support in such areas as information technology, crime analysis, policy, records, disclosure, and Freedom of information.  One of the seven positions was funded through the reduction in overtime and auxiliary staff hours meaning that we received new funding for only 6 civilian positions over a 7-year period.

**Is it true that VicPD wants to increase staffing?**

Yes, VicPD needs to increase staffing in response to growing demands and an increasing population.

For 2019, VicPD asked for an additional 6 police officer positions (4 for the Community Response Unit, 1 Cybercrime officer, and 1 Esquimalt Traffic officer) along with a civilian research analyst.

For 2018, VicPD requested 6 additional police officer positions and 2 civilian staff members.  Both Victoria and Esquimalt Councils approved the civilian positions and Victoria Council approved the police positions subject to Esquimalt Council agreeing to pay its portion of the increase.  Esquimalt Council declined to fund the six new police positions.  

**Is it true that VicPD added 4 officers to ACT?**

No.  In 2016, Councils approved temporary funding to add two police officers to support the ACT, bringing the total number of officers assigned to ACT program to three.  Temporary funding for the two additional ACT officers was extended in 2017 following an independent report regarding police involvement in ACT conducted by the University of Victoria.  A second, more comprehensive, study looking at police integration with ACT is underway.   VicPD is asking for the temporary funding to be extended another year in order for the second study to be completed. 

The two additional ACT officers are not permanent positions at this point and funding for the positions has been from the City of Victoria’s surplus funds, not additional taxation.

**Has VicPD experienced budget increases over the last few years?**

Over the last 8 years (2011 to 2018), VicPD’s operating budget increased by approximately $10.45 million.  The bulk of the increases result from inflationary pressures and labour cost increases in the form of wages and benefits.  Wage and benefit costs have outpaced inflation for the past several years due in part to public safety (police and fire) labour relations legislation and resulting arbitration decisions elsewhere that influence police wages locally.  A scan of police and fire agencies outside of VicPD will show that this trend is consistent across the country and the annual percentage increase for VicPD’s operating budget over the last eight years is in line with the overall increase in the City of Victoria’s operating budget.

**Are crime rates tied to police budgets?**

VicPD has been clear for some time that police resource decisions must take into account a number of factors, including crime rates, crime severity and other similar crime based measures.  What is not captured in crime rates is the gradual evolution of policing from a strict law enforcement focus to a community based policing focus.  This evolution is in response to community expectations that ultimately drive what services the public expect from the police, especially when the needs of the community are not met in other ways or through other services.  As a progressive police service, and similar to many other police services in Canada, we pride ourselves on our evolution to meet community needs and have added the necessary skillsets to meet these modern expectations.  Beyond our proactive approach to meeting expectations, we have responded to legislative changes, changes in case law, and increases in investigative standards and case complexity.  We have also added new services and operational capacities to meet new world threats.  In all cases, these changes are not discretionary and add to the complexity of police work.  We have so far done our best to meet these new challenges without an increase in police officers staffing – but we can’t do this forever.  Despite all the outstanding work by our officers and staff, VicPD is providing services in an area that has among the highest crime severity and highest caseloads per officer in the province because of the jurisdictional boundaries of our region.

**Are calls for service going up or down?**

The number of calls for service that VicPD has received since 2008 is on an upward trend.  The graph below shows the number of calls for service by year while the red line indicates the statistical trend line for this period of time.

**Why does VicPD sometimes deploy officers to address outdoor sheltering and using drugs in public?**

VicPD’s deployment model is determined, in part, by the demands of our citizens.  Our officers are often called to respond to incidents that are not criminal in nature, such as someone suffering a mental health crisis.  Other examples may include someone sleeping in the doorway of a business or blocking a sidewalk, violating the *Trespass Act* or a municipal bylaw. Someone consuming drugs in a public space may be violating federal drug possession laws.   However, while enforcement action may be available to officers, officers will often deal with the complaint in less formal ways, including the referral of individuals to shelters, harm reduction services or other services.  While there may be other ways for the community to respond to some but not all of these situations, in the absence of alternatives, the community calls upon the police to assist.  While our role is to enforce the laws and bylaws enacted by Parliament, the Legislative Assembly or municipal councils, we have been entrusted wide discretion on how to exercise this authority. It is a balancing act that the VicPD and its officers take seriously and we believe manage very well.

Beyond reaction to public complaints, VicPD works proactively with local government, public safety partners, the health authority, services provides, and a host of other stakeholder where we are encouraged and expected to be part of a proactive approach to addressing community concerns in a variety of forms.  We believe that the vast majority of our citizens want and expect the VicPD to be and active partner in this work and we intend to continue to do so.  While some citizens discourage any interaction of police with the marginalized population, most welcome our involvement and appreciate our approach.

Finally, we believe that our officers do a very good job in balancing our enforcement role as partners in community health and safety.  Our front-line officers have been thanked by individuals they have saved from fatal overdoses. They have helped people find housing and facilitated their access to much-needed services.  They are trained in de-escalation techniques and communication.  And they are often the only ones responding to a variety of situations at all hours of the day and night.  In fact, under the provincial *Mental Health Act*, only the police are authorized to “apprehend and immediately take a person to a physician” that is suffering from a mental health crisis and who poses a risk to themselves or others.

**Why does VicPD respond to overdose calls?**

VicPD is not the primary first responder for overdose calls.  Early on, VicPD determined that the overdose crisis was in fact a health crisis, not a criminal one.  Paramedics are the primary responders for these types of calls.  As one of our common law duties is to protect life and property, we have an obligation to assist in these types of calls when needed, or when our officers are close by. 

We are also aware of the myth that police arrest people who are overdosing. On the contrary, our officers have saved lives by administering naloxone to overdose victims. The most recent example of this occurred on January 23rd when a VicPD ACT officer helped save the life of someone overdosing on the street.  We continue to work with our partners to protect both those who are experiencing overdoses while targeting those who prey on our most vulnerable citizens.

A Victoria man is in custody after two incidents - a sexual assault and an indecent act yesterday.

Patrol officers were called to a business in the 600-block of Belleville Street late yesterday afternoon for a report of a sexual assault. When officers arrived, they were met by security staff, the victim and a bystander who had come to the victim’s aid. The victim reported that a male had approached her in a bathroom and sexually assaulted her. The bystander, who was also in the bathroom, intervened and drove the male away. The victim was not physically injured in the incident and did not require medical attention. The bystander reported the incident to security, who in turn called police.

Patrol officers were able to gather a description of the suspect and began to search for him. The suspect was not located at that time.

Just after 10:30 p.m. last night Patrol officers attended a parkade in the 500-block of Yates Street for a report that a male was committing an indecent act while following a female. The victim’s description of the suspect matched the description of the suspect from the sexual assault which had occurred a few hours earlier. Patrol officers located the suspect and took him into custody without further incident. The victim in this incident was also not physically injured.

The male faces recommended charges for the indecent act. The sexual assault investigation remains ongoing.

Officers are asking for your help as we search for a suspect who broke into an occupied home in the Oaklands neighbourhood during the day on Friday, October 19th.

Officers were called to the home in the 2500-block of Shakespeare Street just before 12:30 p.m. for a report that a man had broken into the home while two teenage girls were home alone.

The girls, who were shaken but uninjured, reported that the man first rang the doorbell. When no one answered, he opened the mailbox then went around to the back door. There, he was able to open an unsecured window to reach through and unlock the back door. As he entered the home, he was met by one of the teens inside, turned and fled. The teens then made themselves safe and called a parent for help, who in turn called 911. Despite numerous Patrol officers responding, officers were unable to locate a suspect.

The suspect is described as a Caucasian male in his 50s with long grey and brown hair and stubble. He was wearing a blue/turquoise sweater, and a blue and red baseball hat.

VictoriaBC,VicPDCanada,"We Remember Fallen VicPD Constable Earle Michael Doyle  On this day in 1959, VicPD Constable Earle Michael Doyle succumbed to injuries received in a traffic collision on duty. The 28-year-old constable, who had only been with the department a year and a half, was serving in our Traffic division when he was killed on duty.

Cst. Doyle was riding his VicPD motorcycle northbound in the 3100-block of Douglas Street at approximately 9:00 pm on July 12th, 1959, when a driver turned in front of him. Despite wearing a motorcycle helmet, that had been issued two weeks earlier, he suffered life-threatening injuries. His new helmet appeared to have come unlatched during the collision.

Cst. Earle Doyle succumbed to his injuries in hospital the next day, July 13th, 1959. He was 28 years old. He left behind his wife Grace and young family of three children, Shannon, Kathleen and Kevin.

A week later, citizens lined the streets while uniformed Victoria Police Department and RCMP officers accompanied him on motorcycles and on foot to his final resting place. The photograph above is of that procession.

Detectives are investigating an assault with weapon incident that occurred near the intersection of Johnson and Government streets in the early hours of yesterday morning.

Patrol officers were called to Johnson and Government streets for a report of a stabbing just after 2a.m. on Tuesday, May 29th. When they arrived they located one man suffering from non-life-threatening injuries. More investigators arrived and located a second man nearby, who was also suffering from non-life-threatening injuries. Both these men were taken to hospital and treated. A third man, who was uninjured, was also located.

Investigators currently believe that the incident began as a physical fight involving the three men outside a downtown nightclub located in the 500-block of Yates Street. The men departed, but either by happenstance or intention, came into contact with each other a short time later in the 1400-block of Government Street. During this encounter, a second altercation commenced and in this incident two of the three men received non-life-threatening injuries. 

Investigative Services Division Forensic Identification Unit investigators and detectives were sent to the scene to collect and process evidence and speak with witnesses. 

All three men have been taken into custody. Alcohol is believed to be a contributing factor. Investigators believe that there is no danger to the public.

Our investigation remains ongoing at this time. We will release more information as we are able.

Investigators believe that there are witnesses in the area at the time who have not yet come forward. If you have any information on this incident and have not yet spoke to investigators please call our non-emergency line at (250) 995-7654.

In addition to our parade contingent, VicPD officers and volunteer Reserves will be directing traffic, manning barricades and providing security during the event.

In order to assist with keeping connected with those attending the parade festivities, we will be deploying #VicPDHelps before and during the event. Simply tag us on Twitter or tweet using the #vicpdhelps tag and you’ll be connected to our command centre team. #VicPDHelps has been used during previous events, including Canada Day celebrations to report concerns during the event, and has been used to help locate lost children and provide incident updates. For emergencies, please continue to call 911.

 
#Road Closures in Effect

Road closures will be in effect on the day of the parade and along the parade route. Most roads will be closed from at 7:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. with Belleville remaining closed for the 1:00 p.m. Victoria Day salute at the Legislature. We’ll work to open the roads as early as possible. If you’re coming to enjoy the parade, please consider using transit to get into and out of downtown as parking and vehicle mobility along the route will be limited.

#CCTV cameras Deployed

As with previous events, we will be deploying temporary cameras in support of our operations to ensure public safety during this year’s Victoria Day Parade.

While there is no information indicating a known threat to this event, public gatherings have been the targets of past attacks world-wide. The deployment of these cameras is part of our operations to help keep this event fun, safe and family-friendly. In addition to enhancing security, previous deployments of these cameras have helped locate lost children and seniors at large-scale public events and have provided for effective coordination in responding to medical events.  

As always, we are deploying these temporarily placed, monitored cameras in public spaces in accordance with B.C. and national privacy legislation. The cameras are going up in the next two days and will be taken down a short time after the event.

While during a recent Counter Attack deployment on Saturday, December 29th officers issued one 90-day Immediate Roadside Prohibition, the numbers of impaired drivers on our roads is far too high.

The victims, an older couple, reported to Patrol officers that a man approached them at one of the south entrances to Hillside Mall, near Bolen Books, in the 1600-block of Hillside Avenue around 5 p.m. yesterday afternoon. The man approached the couple and asked them for money.

Concerned for their safety and welfare, the couple handed over a small amount of cash. The man then fled. The couple were not physically injured in the incident and called police.

Additional investigation indicates that this man may have several outstanding victims who have not reported similar incidents.

The suspect is described as a well-groomed Caucasian man, in his 30s, with a small build, standing five feet, nine inches tall. He had short, dark brushed back hair, and a dark moustache and beard. He was wearing a black sport coat and black pants.

A Victoria man remains in custody after a carjacking in downtown Victoria this morning.

Patrol officers responded after several witnesses called our 911 Communications Centre around 6:45 a.m. this morning. Witnesses reported that a man had leapt into the box area of a pick-up truck at the intersection of Fort Street and Foul Bay Road. They reported that the man broke the rear window of the truck, and threatened the driver, who stopped the vehicle, and, fearing for her safety, fled on foot. The man then got behind the wheel of the truck and drove away from the scene, headed against traffic on Johnson Street.

At that point the truck collided with another vehicle that had attempted to avoid it. The truck then continued against the flow of traffic, with vehicles moving to avoid collision. A person riding an electric bicycle also swerved to avoid colliding with the vehicle, but fell doing so. The truck struck a second, parked vehicle.  Another witnesses kept the truck in view until it came to a halt in the 1100-block of Johnson Street. The driver then fled, leaving the vehicle running.

Patrol officers arrived and located the suspect a short distance away. He was arrested without incident. He was transported to cells and then transported to hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. Once treated, he was returned to custody where he remains pending charges.

The other persons involved were cleared medically at the scene.

This incident remains under investigation at this time.

VictoriaBC,Vic_Dude,"Hotel fire delays efforts to house people without homes in Victoria &#x200B;

 

A fire that displaced dozens of residents from the Capital CityCenter Hotel last month has set back efforts to find homes for people currently living in parks.

Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps said this week that it’s unlikely that an alliance of business, government and community groups will meet its goal of moving 200 people indoors by the end of the year.

“The fire really threw a wrench into things,” she said.

The blaze, which broke out Nov. 5, forced the evacuation of the hotel — including more than 80 suites managed by Our Place Society as supportive housing for people with complex needs.

Leah Young, the society’s director of housing and shelter, says B.C. Housing took in 68 of the displaced clients by opening up an unused portion of the former Comfort Inn and Suites, which the provincial government purchased for temporary housing in May.

Our Place then worked with the Victoria Cool Aid Society and other agencies to find placements for another 15 people.

“So we were able to get everybody in,” Young said.

Unfortunately, officials say, that used up some of the units that the Community Wellness Alliance intended to make available for people currently living in homeless shelters or city parks.

The alliance is using rent subsidies from B.C. Housing and Island Health to move people from supportive housing into private-market apartments, which in turn frees up space in supportive housing for people from the parks.

“We did have some folks that have used rent supplements and moved out to private-market units,” said Heidi Hartman, B.C. Housing’s regional director of operations for Vancouver Island.

“But with the fire at Capital CityCenter, we had to use those vacancies to accommodate the folks who were dispersed because of the fire.”

There have been other challenges as well.

The subsidies allow people on income assistance to top up the $375 they receive for rent, so they can pay $750 to $825 a month. But that’s still far short of market rents in Victoria, so the alliance has had difficulty finding rooms.

Helps said 15 to 20 supplements have been used, mostly with landlords who have worked with the program before or people who have basement suites for rent.

“That is presenting as a big challenge,” she said.

Despite the setbacks, the alliance remains committed to moving as many people indoors as it can, Hartman said.

“We’re seeing the successes in the hotels,” she said. “We’ve already had folks move into market housing because they got settled… . And that just speaks to the difference that a roof over your head, and a good meal \[makes\].”

In addition, about five people have moved into Our Place’s Therapeutic Recovery Community, and officials are optimistic that more supportive housing space will open up later this month once people move into two new affordable housing projects in View Royal and Langford.

“I think we’d be in a much better position if that fire hadn’t happened and displaced everyone,” Helps said. “But what we’re really focusing on is moving everyone we can, as quickly as we can.”

VictoriaBC,Vic_Worker3,"City Aims to Get More Youth Involved in Decision-Making Date: Wednesday, February 15, 2017
For Immediate Release
 
VICTORIA, BC – City Council unanimously adopted a strategy designed to get more youth involved in local government. The three-year Youth Strategy, written by a team of 10 youth between the ages of 12 and 25, includes practical and creative initiatives that will help the City strengthen its relationship with youth and involve them in City activities.
 
Youth aged 12 – 24 make up over 15 percent of Victoria’s population yet are underrepresented in the City’s planning processes. This strategy is intended to give young people a voice in local government and be part of planning the future of their community.
 
“A lot can be gained by having youth involved in the City,” said Sol Lindsay, youth team member (aged 18). “Not only can youth provide a unique perspective on city issues, but involvement in the city can build a relationship with government that is fundamental for the future. This strategy will help the City design programs and processes to get young people involved, and it will connect the city with the generations of the future.”
 
The strategy includes more than a dozen ways for the City to involve youth in their municipal government such as:
•           developing a learning tool in partnership with the school district so children and youth are learning about the City in classrooms
•           opening a youth hub as a safe space for youth to hang out and find out about programs and services
•           creating a channel for direct two-way dialogue between City Council and youth
•           getting more youth working at the City through mentorship and co-op programs
 
“It’s really important to get youth involved in planning the future of the city,” said Councillor Jeremy Loveday. “We are making decisions today that will shape the community for a long time to come. Youth deserve to have a say in what their city will look like. I’m pleased we have a roadmap that will help us to support youth to get more involved.”
 
The City will begin implementing the strategy immediately.

Youth Strategy excerpt: “The Youth Strategy is a painting made with the brushstrokes from local youth from all walks of life, adults who work closely with youth, City staff, Council and us. It is the result of our best efforts to build a better city for all youth in Victoria.”

Lindsay Kines / Times Colonist

A plan to redevelop the long-vacant Northern Junk buildings near the Johnson Street Bridge has been sent back to the drawing board — again.

Reliance Properties proposed to rehabilitate two historic warehouses on the site and incorporate them into a five-storey building with 47 rental units, an internal alleyway and a waterfront walkway.

But Victoria city councillors declined to send the project to a public hearing amid worries that the proposed structure “dwarfed” the heritage buildings, which were built on Wharf Street in the 1860s and have sat empty for the past 42 years.

Instead, councillors referred the development back to city staff for further refinements.

Reliance president Jon Stovell, who has been trying to develop the site for 10 years, expressed surprise and frustration at yet another rejection.

“It’s just unbearable,” he said. “I just don’t understand how anybody can think that it’s a good outcome to have buildings sitting vacant for 40 years on the waterfront of downtown Victoria. It’s just really almost beyond comprehension.”

Mayor Lisa Helps objected to yet another delay as well, and warned that council’s perpetual foot dragging is costing developers “hundreds of thousands of dollars” that will translate into higher rents down the road.

""The more time we tack on, the more money it costs,” she said.
A number of heritage advocates, however, urged council to reject the project, arguing that it would damage the character of Victoria’s Old Town.

Steve Barber, the city’s former senior heritage planner, said in a letter to council that the proposal would “radically alter” two of the most significant heritage buildings on the Inner Harbour.

The Caire & Grancini Warehouse, built in 1860, is considered a rare example of work by San Francisco-based architect John Wright, while the Fraser Warehouse, built in 1864, was designed by Thomas Trounce, who arrived in Victoria during the Fraser River Gold Rush era.

Barber said the buildings’ heritage value lies in their modest scale and appearance as freestanding structures.

“The past 25 years have seen a huge investment by the private sector in sensitive rehabilitation of [Victoria’s] commercial heritage buildings,” he wrote. “This proposal, on the other hand, would set a dangerous precedent which will undermine future efforts to conserve the scale and character of one of the finest heritage districts in Canada.”

The city’s own heritage advisory panel opposed the project as well, but there were numerous letters of support, including one from the Downtown Victoria Business Association.

“These old buildings, though valuable for their connections to Victoria’s heritage, are a decaying eyesore at present,” wrote Jeff Bray, the association’s executive director. “If they are not soon rehabilitated, they will fall into complete ruin and be beyond repair.”

City staff also supported the project, while acknowledging some of its challenges, including significant additions to the modest scale of the heritage buildings.

John O’Reilly, the city’s senior heritage planner, noted the “harsh and practical realities” of developing such a small property while restoring warehouses that have sat empty for more than four decades.

“Our file tells the story of how difficult it is to develop this site,” he said. “It’s three volumes thick and, at this point, a graveyard of dead proposals from multiple applicants dating back to 1999.

“Without the benefit of adjacent lands, there’s nowhere to go but up if you’re trying to offset the costs of all the work and meet the very high expectations the city and the public has set for this project: great heritage restoration, high-quality design and materials, a waterfront path extension and frontage improvements — all on this one site. And this is the end result, and it’s not bad.”

O’Reilly said the value of heritage buildings is also contingent on their ongoing use. “And this is what ultimately tips the scales for heritage staff to the higher goal of architectural heritage conservation, which is to animate historic buildings with people,” he said.

But Coun. Geoff Young said council should revisit earlier proposals that envisioned the city selling adjacent land, so a developer could put the bulk of the project there rather than piling storeys on top of historic buildings.

“I think that council should rethink the circumstances that we have created that gave rise to this project,” he said. “And all you have to do is look at it. The buildings are dwarfed by what’s placed on top of them.”

Helps, however, noted that other councillors oppose selling public land for the project.

“So we could essentially continue to freeze this for another four years or until this council ends, and I don’t think that’s a good thing to do.”
Stovell said Reliance tried five or six times to get approval for a big project that involved buying land and building a large development.

“And that never got support, either, from anybody,” he said. “So it just seems like with that site, there’s just nothing good enough.”

In the end, only Helps, Marianne Alto and Sarah Potts voted to send the project to a public hearing. Councillors Young, Ben Isitt, Jeremy Loveday, Sharmarke Dubow and Charlayne Thornton-Joe were all opposed.

Council initially split 4-4 on a motion directing staff to refine the project to better meet Old Town design guidelines. Helps then changed her vote to keep the motion alive and avoid a “quagmire,” she said.

With all the buzz this week about Eagle Creek closing, and the painfully obvious reality that the government funded healthcare has collapsed, perhaps the most direct fix is to allow doctors to charge partial amounts directly to the patient, in addition to the MSP billed amount. 

Your GP walk-in visit would look like this: 

MSP funded: $31.62
Co-pay: $30
-----------------
Doctor paid $61.62 

- Low income people can claim a rebate for the amount
- Use existing extended benefits through an employer to claim reimbursement, same as a physiotherapist or dentist.  

IMO that's still an insanely low amount of money to pay a doctor to provide healthcare for a patient, but it is a doubling of the current amount.

I used to love going to one of the breweries downtown, but have gotten to the point where I'm turned off by the prices. They raised them a little while back, and it's now like $9 for a pint. My local in Oak Bay is also $9 for a pint, and they've largely done away with all the specials. 

I recently found out the Cenote has a wonderful happy hour special - $6 for a pint. That's the best deal  can think of in town, and honestly seems like a good business decision. I imagine there are many people like me who are staying home because of the high prices. How can regulars afford to be *regular* when it's $9 a pint? 

I do sympathize with businesses having to cope with inflation and raise their prices accordingly. And I respect all the small businesspeople trying to make a go in a notoriously difficult market. But it has reached a point where the cost is exceeding the value of the experience --- for me at least. 

Anyone know of any good deals in town? Do ""dive bars"" even exist in this town anymore? Are the high prices were seeing a result of consolidation? Are we headed into a new era where all Vic bars have a similar hipster feel and feature $10 pints and $19 cocktails?","People with lived experience, Reaching Home ",0,False,7.6923076923076925

VictoriaBC,Wild-Excuse,"Question: upgrade my internet without messing things up for landlord? Living in a pretty sweet basement in Oaklands but the internet is brutal - drops all the time. The place is an upstairs and downstairs rental situation, and the router is upstairs.

Landlord seems very tech savvy and I think has done the best they can to get decent internet from Shaw, who says there's nothing wrong from their perspective.

Could just be we're in a basement? But it also could be too many devices - we have 9 just down here, and if the upstairs folks are using the same, well...

I am wondering if there's a way or a point to get our own internet down here - would it be any better?. But the trick is this: I don't want to mess anything up for the landlord who is running cable upstairs and downstairs and I don't know if me setting up our own service would impact him when we leave (probably sometime next year). Would he then have to start paying separate or could he go back to having cable on the same feed?

VictoriaBC,WillingSinger,"Any carpenters out there? I have some questions Hi,

I’m 29 and thinking about a career change intro carpentry. I was hoping to get some advice.

Im interested in carpentry because I like to build things with my hands, and I can use what I learn to do my renovations and builds at home. I also enjoy being outside rather than in front of a screen. With the current housing shortage (especially in Vic) it seems like carpenters will be in demand over the long run. I’m more interested in doing residential versus industrial/construction but not opposed to the latter.

I've never worked in trades, so I’m away i’m potentially naive. With that said, i’m in great physical shape, regularly going to the gym for years, eat heathy, don’t do drugs, and I don’t drink much. I also love to learn. I also understand the importance of being professional (always on time, working hard, not using your phone, reliable etc).

**Questions:**

&#x200B;

* Do you enjoy what you do? Is the work stable? Does work slow in the winter or is it consistent
* Is looking for a $30/hour apprenticeship dreaming? I am medium handy. IE i’ve changed light fixtures and toilets and have used compound and mitre saws, can properly read a tape measure etc.
* If starting out, would you recommend I go to a union or just start reaching out to company’s hiring on Indeed etc? My initial inclination is to try to find an apprenticeship and then look into unions later on.

I have some more questions but i’ll leave it there for now. I would love to hear about your experience and i’m open to any recommendations.

Thanks

VictoriaBC,Winnie_Cat,"Victoria, lets talk merging. Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my frustrations with merge lanes and more specifically, the people using them. 

Merge lanes are meant to help traffic enter and exit the highway safely and efficiently. 

Please do not stop at the beginning of the merge lane and wait for a hole. The lane is meant for you to accelerate to match the speed of traffic. If you are already on the highway and see someone in the merge lane, let them in! 

If it's rush hour and traffic isn't really moving, don't stop at the beginning of the merge lane and wait for someone to let you in. The reason the lane is the length it is, is so you can use it. You aren't cutting in line or cheating, this isn't Walmart. 

If you are already on the highway. Don't try to play traffic cop and block the merge lane. Thats dangerous and you're the reason traffic is as bad as it is. The merge lane is meant to be used as a ""zipper merge"", meaning alternating traffic. Don't try to block cars from properly merging, and don't honk at me for going to the end of the lane like Im supposed to. I'm not trying to sneak ahead of 6 freaking cars to get that much closer, theres no point and you're dumb if you think that way. 

Lots of Victorians need to stop thinking of driving as a competition, and that if I get ahead of you then I'm ""winning"". It's not a game. If you merge and let people merge the way we're supposed, to then traffic will flow more smoothly.

I live in an apartment with carpeted floors. Every once in a while I might see one chilling in a room or bathroom and I'll kill it.

I vacuum regularly, although it is very hard to vacuum behind or under furniture since most of it is not easily moveable. I know apartments that will have a completely full trap of silverfish in just a week. 

So, I am wondering, when do you guys consider it a big enough problem to contact your landlord about it or have pest control deal with it? Is it even worth trying?

We were heading back to the island from the sunshine coast and made it to Tsawwassen at 3.40 for our 5 o'clock reservation. 

Internet said there was no 4pm so we didn't push at the booth. Agent says ""youre reserved on the 5?"" So we pull all the way down the lane and are 4th in the lane. Think, hey it's pretty quiet. Then we see them start loading a ferry.. the 4 does exist, hallelujah! They're nearly done loading the lanes and I call over to the loading team to ask if they can get us on. No dice. Booth Agent should have told us and bumped us before putting us in the lane. They estimated less than 60% full but we'd have to go around to the booth the remaining 8 mins but they can't guarantee anything and sounded doubtful. Somehow, for the car at the front of the line an exemption was made and they let them go on. Apparently they had a res for the 4 and had been bumped when it was ""cancelled""

I don't understand how they can make an exception for one of the 5 cars waiting but not the others. We see more cars streaming through the booth and rolling straight on. 

After a dumpster fire weekend they are now leaving people for a sailing when there's lots of deck space available.

Waiting at the terminal we chat to 2 other families who were booked on the 4 but had their reservation bumped to the 5 yesterday afternoon.

It makes no sense!

Perhaps you purchased it from BC Health Care Matters, the organization that produces them, or even made a donation to support their cause. At first glance, it seemed like a commendable effort, advocating for accessible healthcare for all. Who wouldn't get behind that? Who wouldn't support that? Well, it turns out those lawn signs may not represent what most of us thought they did. The president of the supposedly ""non-partisan"" organization is now running to be an MLA on behalf of the Green Party. Yes, the same person who presented herself as a concerned parent striving to hold politicians accountable has now become a politician herself. It's all about that green!

I wonder how many people who put those ""Everyone Deserves a Family Doctor"" signs in their front yards realize the meaning behind them these days. Currie herself [juxtaposed them](https://twitter.com/CCurrieadvocate/status/1662561322620588032) with her campaign sign on her Twitter page, a striking image indeed. Furthermore, [members of BC Health Care Matters,](https://bchealthcarematters.com/bchcm-about-us) including [Vice-President Sharman Minus](https://twitter.com/TeamCurrieLJF/status/1669375210565271561), have [openly endorsed](https://twitter.com/TeamCurrieLJF/status/1668327556708454400/photo/1) Currie in her campaign, despite their claims of being a ""non-political"" organization. Then there were the BC Health Care Matters [emails](https://bchealthcarematters.com/blog/bchcm-board-of-directors-update) announcing Currie's candidacy and and extolling her virtues as an MLA candidate. I wonder how many people expected to see that in their mailboxes when they signed up for the ""apolitical"" organization's newsletter.

If you believed in BC Health Care Matters and its mission, and if you contributed financially to their cause, how do you feel now that their activities have noticeably dwindled since the electoral announcement? There are no longer rallies, advocacy efforts have ceased, and their social media presence has largely faded away, except for sporadic tweets primarily criticizing the NDP and occasionally retweeting Green Party members and supporters. It raises questions about the ongoing GoFundMe campaign that continues to accept donations. What exactly are these donations supporting?

Isn't it ironic that only six months ago, the individual who professed to fight against politicians and champion ""the people"" has transformed into a candidate for a political party? Healthcare is a contentious issue that affects us all, evoking strong emotions and motivating us to take action. It's a problem we desperately want to see resolved. In our desperation, it's natural to latch onto anything that offers hope, as hope tends to be the last thing to fade away. However, in this case, for many of us, hope has been extinguished. And that ""Everyone Deserves a Family Doctor"" sign may very well serve as its tombstone. Yet, for one individual, that sign seems to have become a steppingstone to a comfortable political career, leaving the rest of us behind WITHOUT access to a family doctor.","Healthcare , Social problem ",1,True,33.33333333333333

I can't afford to buy so would be looking to rent -- right now I live in a newer Langford apartment and I can't afford much more than my current rent of \~1100.

My questions are... 

1) What do you all think the daily commute is like from Shawnigan Lake? Currently, my job is an afternoon shift so I would be avoiding rush hour, but that could very well change. If I do get a permanent position it would likely rotate between day (9-5) and afternoon shifts.

2) Why is the real estate so affordable compared to everywhere else around here? Is it the commute? I've found lots of houses on the market in those areas that are \~500,000 or so which seems really cheap for a lakefront or lake-adjacent property with acreage... (again, not looking to buy at the moment but I was just curious.)

3) Any tips on finding a rental out there? There aren't really any apartments of course in the more rural areas, and there doesn't seem to be much in the way of house rentals/suites.

VictoriaBC,Wyvernna,"Vet tech career Hey all, just wondering if there are any vet techs on this subreddit who might be willing to share their experience about the career, like pros and cons, and that sort of thing?

I'm considering a career change and am looking into this field, but it's hard to know exactly what it would be like without having any experience myself. I have always had a love for animals and I don't want to stay in my current field forever (I'm a medical lab assistant) because there is a lack of opportunity with my qualifications and I don't want to work with human patients, I'm too introverted to enjoy that. I was looking up vet tech jobs just out of curiosity and it seems like there are lots of different opportunities in many different areas of BC. For the training, I am looking at the 2-year program at TRU.

If you would be willing to describe a typical work day that would be great, and/or how you got into the field and your opinion on it as a career, I would super appreciate it. You can PM me if you want. TIA :)

VictoriaBC,YouHadMeAtRuse,"Anyone's Daycare Sending Kids Home? So over the last week, we've had a flurry of messages from our daycare. First it was one classroom shut down with one positive case of covid popping up. Then two. This morning three. Three classrooms, all of them having to be closed completely for ten full days.

It doesn't matter if the kids have no symptoms, they have to quarantine for ten days, which means the entire family has to, presumably? I don't understand why we can't just go get tested, like we used to. Presumably because they're too hard to find right now.

I know caution is necessary, but this seems...bonkers? ineffective?

My worry is also that it could potentially will cost my husband and I (and a lot of other people) our jobs if it keeps up this way, since we have had to repeatedly call in already, due to the daycare's strict policy over the last few months (kids being sent home with runny/stuffed noses).

VictoriaBC,Zacuard,"Looking for rentals and got a weird request from a possible landlord, possible scam? First a bit of backstory,

So i'm looking for a rental starting in May and i posted an ad on Kijiji  outlining this and what I was looking for. This one person in particular shot me a text and then followed up with an email about his place he wanted to rent. Without going into details, it was definitely a good deal but nothing unbelievable we went back and forth and he said he doesn't live here but will be flying down shortly and can show me the place then, so I was a bit cautious going forward. 

Here's the part where I'm not sure if its really just a request or some kind of scam.

He has asked me to create a Kijiji ad for him to help him list another rental that his wife owns as you cannot make an account outside of Canada so he can't do it himself. In exchange he offered to take 100$ off my first month of rent if I choose to rent his place.

This seems like a very innocent thing to ask... yet its just so strange. He gave me all the details he wants me to put in the ad but is this some sort of scam??? It's such an odd request and I would be using my account to post the ad is there someway he can get any of my info by doing that??

The part that really set me off was this line

Me and my partner are kind of being forced to move, and we went to see a bunch of places (a mix of room share/one bed apartments) and every single landlord of one bedroom apartment we went to see, refused to rent to us because they only want 'one person per house'. Some landlords didn't even bother getting back to us after showing us the place and after we sent the application and everything. I repeat, we are talking about a one bedroom apartment, not a bachelor suite. One bedroom apartment with a living ro, kitchen, bathroom, and a bedroom. If they don't want to rent it to a couple, who the heck are they gonna rent it to? I mean who can afford the rent of a one bedroom apartment in Victoria by themselves anyway? And if they didn't wanna rent it to a couple, why waste our time showing us the place in the first place? I have so many questions. Isn't this discrimination? Are they allowed to do that? 

We do fit all of their descriptions too such as no smoking, no pets etc. I don't know if it is because we're both POC, or we are LGBTIQ, I just am frustrated why this is happening.

Edit : as alot of you pointed out, we were not necessarily going to sign a co lease. We can both afford the rent by ourselves, and we did not want to sign a co lease either since my partner usually need to travel out of Canada for work, for a few months of the year atleast.

VictoriaBC,_pocket_dogs,"Campaign against the Richardson Street bike lane came to an end last night **Background**

The CRD first identified Richardson Street around 2011 as a future east-west corridor for the region. In 2012, the Official Community Plan reiterated and established this. These processes involved widespread engagement and consultation.

In 2015, the AAA bike lane network began consultation and engagement. It actually originally identified Fairfield Road as the east-west corridor, but through the consultation and engagement process that lasted nearly two months, the Fairfield neighbourhood expressed that Richardson Street would be the better option for them.

Another round of consultation and engagement then commenced in 2019 to address more specifics about the design. Based on resident feedback, the AAA design was found to be the most suitable because it would reserve parking space.

The bike network has been approved by council at multiple stages and more recently passed final approval. The AAA bike network, several years in the making, had undergone multiple rounds of development, consultation, and engagement. Staff altered many aspects based on that engagement.

**Last several weeks**

As we have seen posted here a couple times, there has been an aggressive and inflammatory campaign to stop the Richardson Street bike lane, under the guise of ""lack of consultation"" and apparent danger to kids. The messaging on the pamphlets, leaflets, and posters largely misrepresented the process and the details of the project. I would argue that it did so knowingly, but it brought along people who in good faith believed there were significant issues.

**Last night**

Last night at council the 2021 budget came to the table for a vote that should have been uncontroversial. Unexpectedly, Charlayne Thornton-Joe announced that she would be putting a motion on the table to remove funding for the Richardson Street bike lane from the budget so that it could undergo further consultation so that everyone could feel heard in the process. The basis for this was the amount of e-mails and phone calls she had been receiving about how the neighbourhood was not properly or fully consulted. Of course, through this discussion, all of the propaganda from the pamphlets, leaflets, and posters were repeated.

Interestingly, before any other councilors could even suggest they disagree with Councilor Thornton-Joe's motion, Stephen Andrew attempted to proactively offer (paraphrasing) ""this is not some coordinated campaign to oppose bike lanes, which Councilor Isitt will surely try to suggest. There is no evidence of that."" Pretty curious that he would say this unsolicited! Mayor Helps rightfully told him not to speculate about what other councilors might say, if they choose to say anything at all about it (Councilor Isitt did not proceed to suggest it was a coordinated campaign.)

This turned into a lengthy debate, but before almost everyone could speak, they had to postpone it until around 10:30 pm because they did not have time for it in the daytime council meeting. When the topic picked up again after public hearings, the councilors who knew precisely what was happening had staff repeat over and over what actually happened in the development and consultation process, and nearly all of the alleged concerns were addressed and minimized by staff's responses which set out clearly that claims like ""slower emergency response times"" had no basis in reality.

Despite this, Councilors Andrew, Thornton-Joe, and Young sided with the phone calls and e-mails they received in the last few weeks, which seems to be a trend for them. They frequently give outsized weight to a small minority who are extremely vocal and spend a lot of time interacting with and messaging city council. What I think they failed to consider is that in the last few weeks, those who have supported the project for YEARS had absolutely no reason to be calling and e-mailing them at this juncture because *the project was already approved*. We had no reason to believe it could be put in jeopardy at 10:30 pm during a budget vote. 

There was no notification to the public that this would be happening last night. This would have been a disservice to the significant amount of work done by staff over multiple years as well as to those of us who have been aware of the project for years and chose to provide our input when it counted. Staff clearly set out to Councilor Thornton-Joe that the consequences of her motion - to seek further consultation - would not fit within their current work plan and they would have to postpone the project until the next phase is complete (James Bay, etc). Alternatively, they would have to now delay the consultation and engagement process for the next phase in order to re-do the consultation and engagement process for Richardson Street, potentially jeopardizing other work already completed that was designed to work with Richardson Street. One way or another, the AAA bike network would see a likely multi-year delay in being completed if the motion passed. Thankfully enough councilors understood this big picture and did not give in to the last minute campaign.",Community Plan to End Homelessness ,0,False,0.0

**Pub fare**

[1550s Pub Style Restaurant](https://1550srestaurant.com/) \- call for takeout and delivery. Delivery is free within a five-kilometre radius and $3 beyond that. Found out about this today thanks to TC article. h/t u/starburst85

[Chicken on the Run](https://www.chickenontherunvictoria.com/) \- Phone and online orders, or in-person. They have their own delivery, but they are also listed on one of the delivery apps. The best hot wings (not ultra hot though) I have had in the city I think. I do not typically like any breading, but it's so well done and not soggy or too rich. They also do Chinese food and fried chicken but I have never tried those.

**Thai**

[Baan Thai](https://baanthaivictoria.ca/) \- Phone orders and they have their own app with no fees. I believe they also offer their own in-house delivery (unsure of cost). Flexible menu for those with allergies, sensitivities, and preferences. They are also listed on the delivery apps.

**Vegetarian & Vegan**

[Green Cuisine](https://www.greencuisine.com/) \- Online ordering, phone, or in-person. Really excellent selection of homemade vegan and vegetarian food, including a wide range of desserts. They have a takeaway buffet option by weight that is mouthwatering (they fill the box for you). It is like Whole Foods (used to be). I have never tried delivery or online ordering, which could be harder to discern if you are not familiar with the items. They are listed on Tutti for delivery.

[Fern Cafe & Bakery](https://www.ferncafeandbakery.ca/) \- Food, coffee drinks and baked goods - all vegan. They have been window orders & takeout the whole pandemic. h/t u/AtomicChom

Has anyone tried takeout from Brasserie? How does it translate?

>[Brasserie L’Ecole](https://www.lecole.ca/) takeout travels super well and we’ve been taking advantage of it most of the pandemic (and will continue to do so after): text them at (250) 217-3640. However, I believe they will be closing for the three weeks once they run out of food. Their website contact page is the most reliable for updates, followed by [Instagram](https://instagram.com/brasslecole). h/t u/VIGirl (they are now closed for three weeks)

Places I want to try but never have: Dosa Paragon, Burger Crush, Bold Butchery and Wind Cries Mary.

Share your suggestions!

Addendum: My own opinion is to avoid the big name delivery apps when possible, especially right now, because of how much of the sale they take. I'm not immune to using them during the pandemic, but I do try my best to pick-up or call places with their own delivery. But sometimes personal circumstances can make it unavoidable. If you can afford it and are going to use them, some of the big name delivery apps let you send direct tips/payments to the restaurant when ordering.

Addendum 2: The [Downtown Victoria Business Association is extending its free delivery program](https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/victoria-business-association-extends-free-delivery-for-restaurants-as-b-c-shutters-indoor-dining-1.5370128):

>From March 31 until April 19, customers who use the Tutti delivery app will not have to pay a delivery fee. Meanwhile, the DVBA says it will be covering restaurants' usual 10 to 15 per cent service charge.

There is a subcategory in the Tutti app for the DVBA sponsored restaurants (I don't believe this program applies to all restaurants listed on Tutti). I know that Tutti experiences are mixed and lean towards unsatisfactory. So YMMV. Delivery times have been the most frequent complaint I have seen, but I would hope that they have scaled up to some degree and learned over time how to mitigate those issues. Anyone with more recent experience (it has been a few months since I used it last), feel free to share your thoughts.

**YMMV: I got a push notification from Tutti today with coupon code ORDERLOCAL for $10 off my next delivery order.**

Tutti Feedback:

>I have used Tutti three times in the last 6 weeks. No issues at all.

Addendum 3: If you are a service / front line worker, or family that does not have the budget for takeout, I will subsidize up to $200 total (up to $25 per order) and possibly re-up this again sometime next week if there is demand.

Some excerpts:    


**Police oversight**  

>We support the creation of a single regulatory oversight body (i.e. combine the IIO and OPCC) that may include the capacity to conduct the investigations themselves. This is a way to reduce the number of overlapping oversight processes, and ensures there is financial accountability to oversight decisions.   
>  
>We support an oversight system based on understanding, mutual benefits, and corrective measures over punitive sanctions. Mediation and conflict resolution should be the primary process except in serious cases. What should be considered “serious” should be defined and consistently applied. We highly encourage oversight processes that permit a streamlined approach for early resolution. Often, full investigations on less serious matters or matters result in delay, unnecessary costs, and do not serve the public interest.   
>  
>While extremely rare, serious police misconduct is most often detected by police agencies themselves, properly reported, and vigorously investigated with oversight in place. This must be recognized. Oversight is critical, but is focused on what has already occurred. We strongly recommend some reallocation of the high costs for oversight toward training and prevention.

**Governance**  

>Review the suitability of mayors holding the statutory position as chair of a police board. It is our view that mayors should not serve as police board chairpersons.   
>  
>Strengthen the independence of police boards and ensure improved understanding of both municipal councils and police boards regarding the powers and responsibilities of each.   
>  
>Set out in legislation defining features of adequate and effective policing in a municipality inclusive of what kinds of preventative services ought to be expected. This will assist police boards and councils in individual decision making and ensure consistency of services between municipalities.   
>  
>Consider a refreshed system of public safety funding to reduce tension surrounding costs.  
>  
>Establish a provincially accepted set of police performance measures against which all BC police services can report on regularly.   
>  
>Avoid US based concepts of direct city/mayor oversight and direction to police.   
>  
>Establish provincial policing standards for assessing police officer staffing levels in a municipality.  

**Police Service Delivery Models**  

>We recommend the province take a leadership role in the structure of policing services and consider leading regionalization where it is likely to result in an overall benefit to the public. We believe that policing and the public in Greater Victoria would benefit from a single, regional police service. A regional police service would require a funding and governance structure, perhaps based on the regional districts model, that addresses funding formulae, voting rights, and other critical governance responsibilities.   
>  
>The policing structure in Greater Victoria is inefficient and unfair. VicPD receives constant criticism related to costs of policing when the reality is that a small tax base supports policing related to the bulk of the regions serious crime, and high call volumes. Often cited statistics on costs of policing are misleading and fail to acknowledge the inefficient system in the Greater Victoria area.   
>  
>While integration of some services has been beneficial, integrated units’ governance can have inefficiencies due, in part, to the tendency for parties to act in the individual best interests of their respective agencies/municipalities. This is an area for consideration with the expansion of integrated policing models. 

**Mental Health, Addictions, Homelessness, and Social Challenges**  

>Recognize that police services have, and will continue to have, a very important role in the community response to complex social challenges. The elevated role of police in recent years has been the result of the lack of effective upstream investments in preventative healthcare.   
>  
>While police ought not be the de-facto response to mental health related incidents in the community in all cases, police are, and will remain, an important part of the response to mental health crises where there is a real or perceived immediate or potential threat to public safety (actual or potential criminality, presence of weapons, violence or threats of violence) or as statute requires (i.e. apprehension authority under the Mental Health Act).   
>  
>Appropriate funding, staffing, training, and resources for police must continue to be part of the available mental health response resources in communities. Improve capacity and legal authorities to facilitate mandatory information sharing between health and police, while maintaining the very important focus on privacy considerations. Each resource possesses important information that will assist the other, facilitating better outcomes for members of the public.     
>  
>It is critical for adequate funding of health authorities to ensure appropriate proactive and reactive response in communities. Upstream mental health and addictions services will reduce the downstream impacts to front-line emergency services, including police.     
>  
>It is important to understand; however, that even very effective upstream programs will only reduce, not eliminate, the need for police involvement in response to public safety concerns. Police involvement in preventative and reactive response to mental health within specialized services (Assertive Community Treatment, Assertive Outreach, Crisis Response) have been proven in research to be effective. Investments in police participation in these models should be expanded as part of a comprehensive healthcare system.

>  
>Top of the list, and affecting all of our communities, is the challenges stemming from the mental-health and substance-use crises.  
>  
>This fall, the province will be in the final stages of its Police Act review. We hope that this review will bring about much-needed modernization of law enforcement. We also hope it will meaningfully address the role that police have come to play as a de facto part of the health-care system.  
>  
>Many of our residents across urban British Columbia are suffering from mental-health and substance-use issues and, increasingly, brain injury.  
>  
>Added to this is a toxic drug supply, growing homelessness, and increasing stigma and anger. This crisis is putting enormous strain on our police departments and RCMP detachments, and it’s stretching municipal budgets already affected by COVID-19.  
>  
>The current police-respond-first approach to mental-health and substance-use calls doesn’t adequately address the reality of the complex needs in our communities for people who continue to fall through the cracks.  
>  
>Because there aren’t enough resources available to address mental health, addictions, homelessness and vulnerable residents requiring complex care, police are frequently called upon to attend to residents struggling with mental-health and substance-use issues. This leads to an expensive download of health-related costs to police, and therefore to local governments.  
>  
>In 2021, Kelowna Regional RCMP will respond to an estimated 4,900 mental-health-related calls, compared with 2,800 in 2016. Between mid-2017 and mid-2021, Victoria has seen an increase from 17.7 per cent to 25.4 per cent of incidents attended by police where the attending officers assessed deteriorated mental health as being a factor in the matter giving rise to police attendance.  
>  
>The magnitude of these types of calls across all our communities strains the primary functions of police. Police are being used to fill the gaps where urgent social support and health care are required.  
>  
>This takes them away from more appropriate front-line responsibilities, such as foot patrols and being out on the streets connecting with the community. It also leaves less time to fight serious crime through proactive, intelligence-led policing.  
>  
>In addition, using front-line police services to address mental health and substance use can be stigmatizing and perpetuates the criminalization of vulnerable people, while, at the same time, forcing police to deal with calls which other services are better equipped to address.  
>  
>The B.C. Urban Mayors’ Caucus proposes specialized health-care teams as a key solution that will allow our police to go back to policing and will provide vulnerable people with the care they need.  
>  
>Access to mental-health and addiction services needs to be consistent throughout the province and resourced by specialized health care teams available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in the same way our policing system operates.  
>  
>Currently, if someone is having a mental-health episode in one of our downtown streets in the middle of the night, there are no emergency mental health services available, there is no one but police to call.  
>  
>Current models such as Assertive Community Treatment Teams, Assertive Outreach Teams, and the Integrated Mobile Crisis Teams are making progress, but they need increased investment and capacity from the provincial government.  
>  
>Local governments rely primarily on property taxes to fund all services; this is not sustainable, and this funding source cannot meet the existing and growing need. Local governments should not be responsible for health-care provision through policing. In addition, the province should seek ways to fund civilian-led health teams for when police are not required. These teams should be available 24/7.  
>  
>Police can continue to play a role with these teams, but should be actively involved in an incident only at the request of the specialized health team or if there is a risk to public safety. And wellness checks should always be performed by health-care workers who have specialized knowledge and training.  
>  
>In terms of dispatch, having the 911 fire-police-ambulance options as the only choices if someone is in urgent mental distress does not meet the needs of residents in mental-health distress as it most often results in armed police attending health-based situations, which can escalate tensions.  
>  
>Other alternatives — including a fire-police-ambulance- mental health option or an expanded 811 call system — should be considered.  
>  
>We are grateful the province is reviewing the Police Act.

VictoriaBC,_pocket_dogs,"Possible last chance to share your input on city's Missing Middle Housing Initiative Mayor & Council were set to vote on the missing middle plan last week on May 5. A 5-4 majority, however, decided to postpone the matter until this week to allow the public to digest all of the documents and provide input to them despite the vote not being a public hearing.

The vote tomorrow is only to move the proposal forward to the next stage, but this stated reasoning by the majority has effectively made the vote tomorrow a quasi-public hearing when their minds should really be turned to simply whether or not it is suitable to go to public hearing. A majority of councillors had already voted it forward on two separate occasions without reservations, but Stephen Andrew has seemingly reversed course as his comments last week - and decision to vote in favour of postponement - indicate he may not longer support it. Ironically, the apparent reason he has concerns revolve around affordability, which the proposal did not previously address when he voted strongly in favour of it. This latest version actually has added an affordability component.

Previously the proposal has been supported by Helps, Loveday, Alto, Potts, and Andrew.

Voting to postpone last week were Andrew, Dubow, Isitt, Thornton-Joe, and Young. Helps, Loveday, Alto, and Potts voted against postponement. 

Today is probably the last day to send correspondence or contact a councillor with your thoughts. Some of the five who voted to postpone are likely going to base their vote on their perception of where the public stands, so it is important that you provide them with your position on it. The contact page for mayor and council is here: [https://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/city/mayor-council-committees/contact-mayor-council.html](https://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/city/mayor-council-committees/contact-mayor-council.html)

The jist of the proposal is this:

&#x200B;

* Allow townhomes (up to 10 or 12 units) on corner lots in traditional residential zones of the city. Allow houseplexes (up to 6 units) mid-block.
   * Currently the only housing form allowed in those zones by-right are single detached dwellings with a suite, and in some cases, a duplex.
* Missing middle housing projects must include a minimum of 2 units with 3-bedrooms, or 30% of total units. Whichever is greater.
* Tenure can be strata, rental, co-op, or co-housing.
* ADUs, such as garden suites, secondary suites, and lock-off suites are permitted.
* Base density is 0.5:1 FSR. Bonus density is achievable if the applicant provides a cash contribution of $107.63 per square metre of bonus floor space. 70% of this cash will be directed to the housing reserve fund and 30% to the local amenities fund.
* Applicants may, instead of the above cash contribution, directly provide below market strata or rental units.
* At least one accessible parking stall is required for every project.
* Parking requirements can be reduced by utilizing transportation demand measures (car share, etc)

VictoriaBC,_sunshineeeee,"Provincial park camping availability this fall? Hi - I'm new to the island and looking to go on my first camping trip here this fall. My understanding is that parks are first come first serve after the first week of Sept. 

I've heard from people in passing about how extra busy camping is this year, which makes sense. I figured that it may be less busy once school resumes, but it's hard to gauge since I don't have much knowledge about BC camping or know many people here. 

**Is it likely to be able to get a first-come first-serve spot at one of the Southern island provincial parks (Goldstream, French Beach, Sooke etc) in mid-late Sept and Oct?**  

Unfortunately I wouldn't be able to get to the spot before registration (7 am) as car rental places open after that. 

(I'm aiming for a Provincial park as I figure that's probably safest, being a new female solo camper). 

Any insight you could offer would be really appreciated. Thanks!","Camp, Camper, Camping",0,True,40.0
VictoriaBC,_thewildwest,"Alcoholic seeking help getting sober Basically the title. 

I’d prefer not to get into the nitty gritty details just due to the sensitive nature of this topic, but to make a long story short - I experienced the loss of 3 family members in the awfully short timespan of 1 month at the beginning of this year. Quickly followed by the death of my beloved pet of 18 years, the death of a close friend a week after that, and finally the extremely tragic and sudden death of my absolute best friend on this Earth for my entire life a month after that. She was more like a sister to me than a best friend, and our lives and families were so intertwined that this rocked the foundation of both of our worlds and families.

I’d never been much of a drinker before this. I probably only drank a handful of times per year (~10 or less) and only ever drank on special occasions like birthdays, holidays, or other events and never drank to excess. If I’m being honest, I have always preferred the devils lettuce to alcohol and for the majority of my life - only ever engaged in the use of that. But shortly after the loss of my family members in January, I kind of spiralled and there hasn’t been a single day since then that I’ve not consumed an alcoholic beverage. In the beginning, I was drinking in order to fall asleep because the grief and depression had gotten so bad that insomnia became a very real problem for me and I’d be awake for 2-3 days at a time. But now, it’s an all day, every day kind of thing.

Even though I’m still dealing with insomnia at the current moment, I would really really really love to get my drinking under control (and ideally, stop drinking entirely) because I’m genuinely concerned for my health and safety at this point. I haven’t experienced any sort of withdrawals, but I notice that I have been relying on alcohol as a crutch and as someone who has a parent that has lost themselves to addiction it seriously scares the shit out of me.

Then again, I might decide to upgrade to an 'uber-awesome' higher speed (120 or 150), so it would require a 24 channel modem as they clearly indicate.

This is just a curious questions of mine and I didn't mean to judge or debate here.
I have moved to Canada 3 years ago but I noticed it's not easy to find a family doctor, walk in clinic, midwives in Canada? Does Canada has doctors, nurses, midwives shortage or bigger population that need urgent healthcare everyday?

Because during the last year after COVID subsided and clinic finally accept walk in, there were time I tried to book appointment with virtual doctor or walk in clinic just to get referral for lab tests and it's always full or fully booked. One of the clinic said they start accepting booking every Monday. So since I worked night shift, I sent the booking request before 1AM for Monday or Tuesday appointment and they replied me around  10AM that they're fully booked already for Monday and Tuesday. I was surprised 
Now I am trying to find any doctor or midwives to get referral for prenatal screening, but most I have contacted said they're fully booked but they put me on the waitlist. I try to understand how the healthcare system work here and wonder if we have a very high population in Victoria or shortage of Doctors? Even for the virtual doctors.

VictoriaBC,adriannejoe,"Looking for rescue or shelter to adopt any puppy or young dog that allowed walk-in/meet the dog/apply for adoption in person. Hi all,

I and my partner has been looking to adopt a young small to medium dog. We have been applying to adopt from some rescues but haven't heard anything yet. I understand that maybe the rescues found better match of the dog. So I have been thinking if there are any rescue/shelter in Victoria that accept people to walk in and see the dog in person then do the interview or application in person too?

The reasons is I am still insecure with my English, and I think my last phone interview with a rescue didn't go well, as she had to keep on repeating her questions and she didn't understand what I said. Although in the end, my husband helped me with it.
Also, there are couple things that seems to be red flags :
1. It's my first time to adopt a dog. My husband is more experienced but since he is working full time morning to afternoon, I will be the main caretaker.
2. We are living in a condo with no fenced yard. Although we are living at the oak bay and close to many parks.
3. Both of us are full time workers. Although, my husband is working for since morning to afternoon meanwhile I work remotely for late night shift until dawn. I already explained in the adoption application too.
4. I don't have any references. My only reference in Canada is my husband's family. Meanwhile in most applications, I have to put non-family references.

So I was thinking if I maybe I can go to see the dog in person and see if any of the dog would like me so I can apply for the dog, if it's possible?


PS: I also read about the option of contacting breeders on another threads but we have no experience with breeders,so we don't want to risk it. Also when applying to the rescues, they have the profile of the dogs and their preferences, so we can know if the dog personality will match our family.

Why I am interested? 

I am a researcher with a Ph.D. in Chinese literature. Coal Island was, surprisingly the site of a retreat of one of the great Chinese reformers. In 1898, Kang Youwei led a series of reforms called the 100 Day Reforms. They almost set China on the path to modern nationhood, something like Meiji Japan. 

As you might have guessed, the reforms were abortive. After 100 days, conservatives in China's government held a counterrevolution, sweeping reformers from power. Kang Youwei's brother was executed. Kang Youwei barely escaped. He left via Hong Kong, to Japan, and then, in 1899, he spent a great deal of the summer ensconsed on Coal Island (which he called 文島, Literature island). A supporter of Kang's, Wei the 4th, apparently owned Coal Island and had a farm there. Kang Youwei lived on Coal Island in a Tent which he referred to as The Wide Heavens Hut. He wrote 19 poems about his time on the island. Here is one:  


Far across the seas we celebrate Your Majesty’s birthday,

The dragon banner unfurls above the white men’s buildings.

White people, clinking their glasses, assemble grandly beside us;

While the yellow race squeeze, with lighted lanterns, through narrow lanes.

The lord on high grants You life, and has pity on us here below.

A petty official, prostrate, in tears, lies in bitter obscurity.

From this distant Canadian island I gaze toward Beijing:

Waves around the Emperor’s palace-prison; how often I return in my dreams.

Me:  Take a hypothetical approach to envision a future in which the 13 constituent municipalities of the Victoria (BC) Capital Regional District are consolidated to deliver services more efficiently.  

ChatGPT:  In a consolidated Victoria Capital Regional District, the 13 constituent municipalities would be merged into a single entity, allowing for more streamlined and efficient delivery of services. This could result in reduced duplication of services and administration, leading to cost savings and improved resource allocation. The consolidation would also provide a unified approach to regional planning and decision making, potentially leading to more coordinated and effective solutions to regional challenges.

However, consolidation also has the potential to create challenges, such as balancing the needs and perspectives of different communities within the new entity and addressing concerns about loss of local control. To ensure success, a thorough planning and implementation process would be needed to address these challenges and ensure a smooth transition to the new system. This could involve engaging with residents, stakeholders, and elected officials to understand their priorities and concerns, and developing strategies to address them.

Overall, a consolidated Victoria Capital Regional District has the potential to deliver improved services and regional outcomes, but careful planning and implementation will be crucial to its success.

I am planning a move to your lovely city / island within the next six months, and I have a few questions:

- I will most likely be working in a public sector role of some kind. I presume all the gov buildings are located right downtown?
- is it reasonable to find a spot just on the outskirts of the city (bedroom communities) to save costs on rent? What would the commute be like?
- what are some of the better spots/nhbds in and out of the city? I live near downtown Edmonton so I regularly encounter junkies, etc. Not a dealbreaker for me. 
- what are some of the local classified sites for rentals? I have tried Kijiji and RentFaster, but there is very little out there right now. Any other ideas?

VictoriaBC,alpinecoast,"Jack Knox: Why Victorians so Uptight  

The batteries in his 97-year-old grandmother’s hearing aids were failing, so Tristin Hopper had to raise his voice to be heard in the noisy Sunday morning Victoria restaurant.

That was too much for the aging baby boomer at the next table. “You’re RUINING everyone’s breakfast,” said the man, dramatically gesturing toward a table full of diners who couldn’t care less.

Ruining. That’s what he said. Hopper and his gran had been talking about church. Just imagine if they had been discussing pipelines, or bike lanes, or cherry blossoms, or one of the other subjects that really send Vancouver Islanders off their nuts.

Now, were this in the 31-year-old Hopper’s youth, he would have just shrugged. Old people yell at young people.

It’s what the Oak Bay High grad learned while growing up here. Chew gum with your mouth open or wear the wrong shirt and you’ll get a super-helpful hectoring from someone who thinks you should know what you’re doing wrong. “As a child of Victoria, I thought that this was just normal.”

But then he moved away, went to school back east, and ended up working elsewhere in Canada, where he learned that no, this is not acceptable behaviour. “You would get laughed at. Someone would make fun of you.”

So Hopper, now an Edmonton-based reporter for the National Post (which to some Islanders is enough of a crime to warrant an application of non-petroleum-based tar and free-range, organic chicken feathers) posted on Twitter: “I’ve been 48 hours in Victoria and a man just lectured me for talking too loudly to my hard-of-hearing 97-year-old grandma IN A CROWDED RESTAURANT. People never believe me when I tell them the West Coast is uptight.”

Uptight? Us? This is the City of Gardens, laid-back Lotus Land, the only place in Canada where legalization made it harder to buy weed.

Even the panhandlers park on yoga mats. Our bunnies get palliative care, or at least an airlift to a sanctuary in Texas (I’m not making this up).

Ours is the hacky-sack city that replaced the grim-lipped parking police with kinder, gentler, blue-jacketed “ambassadors” (which means what? They dot the “i’s” on your tickets with little hearts?).

Yes, but it’s also a rule-heavy government-and-military town (civic motto: “Solving the world through regulation since 1862”) that loves to tell people how to live.

Victoria toyed with turning off its Christmas lights because apparently you don’t know you’re wrong-headed for liking them. (No truth to the rumour that city hall plans to replace the Sir John A. statue with one of the judgmental Church Lady from Saturday Night Live.)

Saanich says residents are supposed to register hens, just like handguns. Esquimalt banned Bongy the head shop mascot.

Want to see the SWAT team in action? Try parking your boat in your driveway in Oak Bay.

Is there any city in Canada where you are more likely to be yelled at by a stranger? (Try standing up at a concert and dancing — I dare you.)

Is there another region whose residents keep the bylaw officers on speed dial, or hand out unsolicited parenting advice?

Our busybodies are both young and old, and span the ideological spectrum. Too many used-to-be powerful people with too much time on their hands.

Too many indignant, self-righteous people imbued with the self-certainty of those who have not yet learned the value of doubt.

Too many people whose opinions are shaped in echo chambers, free of the complicating influence of dissenting opinion and unconsidered perspective. (That’s not just a West Coast thing.)

Too many people who, without a sense of entitlement, would have no sense at all.

One of those who responded to Hopper’s tweet spoke of West Coasters as being both “surrounded by beauty and so angry.” That’s not a new observation — in 2015, a Statistics Canada study of life satisfaction found the Victoria region to be one of the unhappiest in the country, 27th out of 33 metropolitan areas, with Vancouver at the bottom of the list.

Of course, that might not be your experience, and you might say those who think us uptight are out to lunch.

But if they are out to lunch, please don’t yell at them.","Lived Experience, People with lived experience",1,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,alpinecoast,"Ship Point Revitalization Like the Joni Mitchell song in reverse, the City of Victoria hopes to replace a parking lot with a bit of paradise as it revitalizes Ship Point.

Ship Point — the parking lot below Wharf Street at Fort Street — has for years been derided for providing parked cars with some of the best views in the city.

“A key and potentially beautiful site along the waterfront being used as a parking lot has long not been viewed as the best use for the site,” said Joaquin Karakas, senior urban designer for the city and manager of the Ship Point project.

A nine-metre drop now separates Wharf Street from the waterfront parking lot below.

Karakas said one of the key goals is to better connect downtown pedestrians to the water’s edge. “That’s achieved by incorporating a grand staircase and some sloped or terraced lawn areas that integrate some ramping that would be accessible to all users,” Karakas said.

The design concept envisions a new pavilion to the north end of the site, providing the lower level with a year-round commercial building. Much of the existing parking lot would be replaced with sloping, terraced green space.

The concept includes underground parking for 25 to 30 vehicles.

The roof of the new pavilion would become an extension of Wharf Street, providing a viewing platform.

A new waterfront amphitheatre for events and festivals would take advantage of a sloped lawn as a seating area.

“There’s a sloped portion [there] now, but right now it’s heavily landscaped with trees and isn’t really accessible for people to go in and sit down. So one of the things we’re looking to do is kind of open it up a little bit and provide a range of opportunities for people to stay and linger at the site, while also implementing a key portion of the [David Foster] Harbour Pathway for people moving through the site,” Karakas said.

The plan includes an urban beach near the Harbour Air Terminal.

Mayor Lisa Helps called the concept exciting.

“It reads as a park. It is what is deserving and befitting of a capital city,” Helps said.

The city is seeking public input on the concept at two open houses at the site this weekend — Saturday from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Monday from 4:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. — and through an online survey beginning Saturday at the city’s website, victoria.ca.

No cost has been set for the project. If approved, it will almost certainly be undertaken in phases.

Victoria councillors will discuss the concept in September and provide direction before detailed design work occurs.

“To me, the most important part of this plan is getting to implementation, because we’ve had plan after plan after plan after plan,” Helps said. “So I’m looking forward in the fall to staff bringing us an implementation plan … and actually getting shovels in the ground on a part of this next year.”

VictoriaBC,alpinecoast,"Victoria councillors expected to green light two-way separated bike lane on Fort Street Victoria councillors are expected to give the green light this week to a new two-way, separated bike lane to run on the north side of Fort Street despite continued concerns from businesses in the area.

The $3.19-million project, similar to the two-way separated bike lane that opened last month on Pandora Avenue, has faced opposition from downtown businesses worried about loss of parking and problems loading and unloading goods and passengers due to road narrowing.

Angst among business owners over the proposed bike lanes reached such a fever pitch this year that Mayor Lisa Helps wrote letters of apology to 120 merchants along the street, promising better consultation.

Now, with the final design and a staff recommendation to go to tender on council’s agenda on Thursday, some of those merchants say the consultation amounted to little more than lip service.

“There’s been no real request for our input. Any changes that we would be allowed to make would be just minor esthetic changes like throw a bike rack here or put a planter here,” said Jason Cridge, owner of Cridge Family Pharmacy. “We had no input whatsoever on the large-scale design of the bike lane on this street so a lot of owners are just disenchanted.”

The new bike lane is to run from Wharf Street to Cook Street. The design reduces the 500 and 600 blocks of Fort to one vehicle travel lane.

Rob Simon, of Paul Mara Jewellers, said the single travel lane could create a nightmare of congestion as motorists try to parallel park or as businesses receive deliveries.

“I look at this and [they] say that we’ve engaged them as merchants and it just seems as though they did not listen to us,” Simon said, adding that he’s not opposed to cycling, but the design on Fort doesn’t make sense. “If it doesn’t work, it’s going to have to be reassessed and we’ll find a council that’s more friendly to business.”

Helps said she is confident that once the bike lanes are in place, business concerns will evaporate as more customers ride by their businesses on bikes. “Is it hard? Yes. Are businesses opposed? Yes. Is construction going to be challenging? Absolutely. The next four or five months will be challenging. But we know from evidence from around the world that when this kind of infrastructure is built, businesses benefit.”

She said staff have evaluated the commercial loading zones and are convinced the proposal will work. “Our staff have worked inch by inch across the block with the commercial delivery folks and they found that they are going to make it work.”

The 500 and 600 blocks of Fort bear the brunt of parking loss and will see 18 parking stalls removed. Thirteen other stalls will be eliminated elsewhere on the 1.2-kilometre stretch.

An option costing an additional $500,000 would modify the north side sidewalk in the 600 block, preserving eight parking spots or providing another travel lane, but staff recommended against it, citing heavy foot traffic in the area and the high cost of the change.

A staff report says the recommended design “reflects a series of stakeholder feedback and comments, but is unable to accommodate all requests due to safety, costs and design trade-offs.”

The Fort Street cycling corridor will be separated from traffic using a combination of paint and bollards, parked vehicles and concrete barriers. There will be dedicated traffic signals for cyclists and green paint will be used at intersections and driveways.

Other elements include repaving of bike lanes; improvements to existing pedestrian crossings at Langley, Broad and in the 700 block of Fort; relocation of the parklet in the 700 block; addition of nine new trees; 23 new bicycle racks, 10 new public benches; three new audible countdown signals; bicycle corrals; new motorcycle parking in the 600 block; new passenger and commercial loading zones; and replacement of some of the sidewalk in the 700 block.

Helps has told staff she wants the project started no later than Sept. 30.

After being denied 5 apartments despite having perfect credit and references and two incomes that could pay three or more times the monthly rent amount, I found out that the biggest management company in Victoria BROWN BROTHERS has a blatant discrimination policy against people with children that says they will not rent to people with children unless it is the ground floor or above a carport because it is too much of a disturbance. The acting manager at 879 Esquimalt Road told me this to my face when we showed up to view an apartment: ""I can show you the unit, but I'm going to let you know we will not rent it to you because you have a baby. Sorry, that's just Brown Brothers policy"". I told him that was an obvious human rights violation, and he said ""Well, it is and it isn't.""

If you are wondering, it is in fact a major human rights violation. When I spoke with Human Rights Tribunal, even they were shocked at this. Looking back at some of the apartments we were either denied or did not get a reply to our email, most of the time they were Brown Brothers units. 

Please, if you have children and have been denied an apartment rental by the Brown Brothers, or any other agency for no apparent reason, I urge you to file a formal complaint. It costs you nothing: http://www.bchrt.bc.ca/process/complaint/index.htm. You have 6 months from the date of interaction/denial and be sure to include as much information as possible. This so-called policy of theirs is discriminatory and needs to change and it will only change if enough people speak up.

We am currently living in Victoria and are looking for a new place to live, anywhere within the greater Victoria area. This is our 2nd time moving within the Victoria area, so I don't feel like I have a good understanding of the way rentals work in Victoria. 
We came over from Vancouver about 3 years ago, and that first move to Victoria was frustrating, as it took our current landlord over a week to respond to our desires to see the place. We chalked it up to our landlord being a bit flightly and/or disorganized. But, we managed to get the place in time for our move. 
Now, almost 3 years later, we are looking for a cheaper place. We have only been looking for 3 weeks, but have run into some problems. We're not sure if it is just how things are in Victoria, or if we are doing something wrong in the way we are responding to craigslist postings. 

I will list a few things that have struck us as strange.

1. We've responded to over 15 ads, and have only heard back from 3 or 4. (Is this normal?)

2. Every landlord can only show places during 9-5 M-F hours. Seriously? I have to turn down shifts and lose precious money in order to see a place (I'm a substitute teacher), and my husband has to leave his work for an hour to see places. When every landlord expects us to make showings during the day, those lost hours can equate to a lot of lost wages. 

3. An hour before we were to see a place, the landlord cancels the appointment, saying it was already rented. 
(I wasn't impressed, but didn't see anything wrong with it at the time)

4. I got an email response to an ad that was sent at 7:45am today. They wanted to show it to us on Monday during the day. I wrote back asking for an early evening/weekend viewing around 8:30am. They promptly responded, saying that the place had been rented. Seriously?!? I'm to believe that the place got rented between 7:45 and 8:30am?

Anyway, I don't understand what is going on. Is it something we are doing incorrectly? The emails/messages I leave describe us as 30-something working professionals in a pleasant tone. 

Maybe this is typical for rentals in Victoria? It's already been so much more frustrating and difficult than any of the moves we did on the mainland. 

We'd love some advice if you have any!

Thanks!

I'm thinking about renting out my basement suite/spare rooms.  My place is close to UVic on the Saanich side, so it could potentially be a viable option for university students or professionals wanting to get away from the urban lifestyle or suburban commute.

I'm fairly new to the business of landlording, so I was reading various resources on pros and cons, tricks and tips, etc.  However, are there any considerations that I should make that are specific to Victoria rental market?

VictoriaBC,arthouse_56,"I received a 10 day notice to end tenancy but it was the property management company’s error As a result of a recent experience with the property management company I’ve been renting from for just under one year, I’d suggest renters do an internal audit of your costs and payments every now and then. 
I was set up on automatic payment via the company and yet received a notice I owed $100. When I asked why, I was told by the property manager that he didn’t know and to look at the accounting ledger provided. I told him I had looked at the ledger and couldn’t figure out why I owed extra since they set my automatic payment up, and that I’d need to know why I owed extra money before I’d agree to pay it. 

Two months passed and there was no more communication from them. I figured they had found the error and didn’t think much more of it until I received a 10 day notice to vacate because of unpaid rent/utilities. It was delivered on a Friday just before the end of day and their office closes early on Fridays, so I was unable to immediately speak with them. It said I now owed $150. 

It costs $100 to file a dispute with the Residential Tenancy Branch and I had 5 days to do it, but it appeared the weekend is included in those five days. 
I spent a very stressful weekend searching and compiling any and all correspondence from the property management company I had ever received. I found their error and they now owe me $90 and retracted the 10 day notice. 

They had been overcharging me and had errors internally. I can’t help but think of the number of people who would’ve paid the extra money. It was a real lesson to me in keeping proper files and doing one’s own audit once a year.

Edit: company name is Devon Properties managing for Starlight Investments whose website says they offer shareholders a 25% return on investments while at the same time talking about how they “build community” and contribute to sustainable development. 

An additional issue I’ve ran into with them is when I wanted to give up my storage locker, Devon’s form said I was required to give one month notice BUT i ad to have all items removed the next day because they reserved the right to rent it out to someone else immediately.

Is it based on period of time, or maintaining private space in the dwelling, or something else? I figure there must be guidelines somewhere, or landlords would definitely abuse this.

VictoriaBC,autobored,"Globe Editorial: Cities promise housing – and then make new rules that prevent it. [Victoria’s Missing Middle a failure] 
Cities promise housing – and then make new rules that prevent it: Politicians, most of whom are homeowners, have long failed to see the urgency in the country’s housing market

Victoria early this year approved a citywide overhaul of its restrictive zoning to get more housing built. And, then, nothing happened. Vancouver is poised this fall to approve a citywide overhaul of its restrictive zoning to get more housing built – and city planners predict very little will happen.

How is it that splashy plans to enact major changes lead directly to an entrenchment of the status quo? It’s the difference between the headline goal – loosening rules to permit multiple homes on lots long reserved for a detached home – and the detailed regulations that end up undermining that goal and effectively ensure nothing much changes.

The housing market is tilted against new buyers and renters, with existing and new supply running well below demand. This is the root cause of Canada’s housing supply squeeze and blame can be pinned on local politicians who oversee rules that allow – and mostly disallow – new housing. For decades, the only thing you could build on most residential land was a detached home. Vancouver is a good example. More than 80 per cent of the land has been occupied by 35 per cent of the people.

In recent years, the cost of housing surged to dizzying levels. Restrictions on supply have been compounded by ever-stronger demand from a rising population. As of last year, loud calls for changing the rules finally rang through at city councils previously impervious to the idea.

Victoria at first appeared to be the leader of change. The city’s missing middle policy – multiunit housing of several storeys in height – was approved in January. It allows six homes on one lot and in some cases as many as a dozen, without a contentious, expensive and elongated rezoning process.

Yet the city then piled on numerous rules, including building height, parking and added costs. It’s akin to opening a door and immediately bolting it shut. The result is a policy that was supposed to help get many new homes built led to development applications of zero new homes.

Vancouver expects a similar result. City council this fall is set to approve a plan that would allow as many as six homes on one lot. The city calls it “very bold.” But the city plans to impose extra costs and heavily limit the size of buildings. The city itself predicts the plan will see only 150 new multiplexes built per year – just several hundred homes. In a city desperate for housing, Vancouver’s reaching for a garden house to fight a wildfire.

Politicians, most of whom are homeowners, have long failed to see the urgency in the country’s housing market. Leaders at higher levels of government have finally moved to intervene, such as in Ontario and British Columbia.

Despite these efforts, the main problem remains mayors and city councils that are doing as little as possible. Four homes on one lot is definitely a step forward, if the rules were crafted to actually get such projects built. But it’s not enough, when the goal is to moderate sky-high prices to buy and rent. Vancouver and Toronto need to allow four-storey apartment buildings, with dozens of homes in each, to be built across the city, especially around public assets such as schools and parks. Right now, such buildings are allowed on a fraction of civic land.

While Victoria and Vancouver make missteps, Toronto shows some promise. The city in May allowed up to four homes on one lot and didn’t layer on onerous restrictions. It is a good although modest first step. Olivia Chow, the new mayor, has pledged to back new housing. A push from the province, with specific housing targets, has made a difference, too. Data indicate Toronto is opening up to new homes: housing starts in the city are up about 50 per cent since the start of 2022, compared with the two previous decades. Toronto, however, is an exception. Most other cities in Ontario are way behind.

Victoria, meanwhile, has realized its mistakes. The city is reviewing its new rules, to see where it went wrong, and plans more changes this fall. Vancouver city council has a chance this fall at a public hearing to also loosen its plans before it locks in rules that it knows will lead to little change.

Canada needs a lot more new housing. Civic leaders must stop undermining that essential goal by making sure the fine print supports the headline promise to build many more homes. The big picture is obvious. Getting the details right is what will make a real difference.

VictoriaBC,b_vy,"Langford teen shovels West Shore bus stops to help commuters  

Alex Meikle didn’t spend his snow days the way other 14-year-olds were.

While many teenagers are taking the days off as an opportunity to sleep in and hang out with friends, Meikle and his friend — who did not want to be recognized — took it upon themselves to help commuters on the West Shore.

On Tuesday, the pair got their snow gear and shovels out and shovelled 56 bus stops on the West Shore along routes 50 and 52.

They started at 8 a.m., hopping on and off buses to shovel and salt stops on their way.

“We saw some people struggling to get on and off the bus … we decided to take the initiative and get out and do good,” Meikle said. “An older lady came up and said the bus provides her with freedom … and obviously freedom should never be taken away from someone so that provided us with some more motivation.”

&#x200B;

Meikle said a BC Transit driver let other drivers know what they were up to so they could get rides for free. He said a Starbucks also gave them a bag of salt to use.

“We’ve gotten amazing amounts of support from the community … from the bus drivers,” Meikle said. “We’ve had people come up to us thanking us … offering stuff but we’re not asking for anything, we don’t want anything.”

Meikle is a Belmont Secondary School student and said he likes being involved in the community. He is hoping to be an advanced care paramedic one day which motivates him to be a community advocate.

He hopes he can encourage other teenagers to get out there and give back too.

Meikle, who takes the bus to and from school, said he can’t imagine what it is like for people with mobility issues who rely on public transit to get around.

&#x200B;

On Tuesday he even borrowed a snow-blower from a store to help clear a sidewalk for a woman in a wheelchair and has offered to help people shovel while waiting to catch the bus.

He said the highlight of his day was when an elderly woman gave him a hug and thanked him.

“I was the reason she was able to go outside,” Meikle said.

Meikle continued to clear bus stops on Wednesday, taking a quick break to speak with the *Goldstream News Gazette*, and planned to work well into the evening.

After one woman posted on Facebook about him, he sent out a tweet which he expected would only be seen by a few of his followers.

Now, Meikle said he is getting all sorts of “thank yous” and encouragement online. But he’s not doing it for the recognition.

“All I did was move some snow,” Meikle said.

VictoriaBC,balloongotloose,"Just went for a move in inspection and the place was in disrepair. Background to story.    We were able to take a look at this place about a month ago as the tenant skipped on rent and left the place in a hurry.   Huge mess, some furniture left there etc.   
We were told the place would be repaired and cleaned before we took possession, and would need to put down a security deposit to hold the place.  
Liking the neighbourhood, we did that. 

We show up today and the place is virtually unchanged and looks like a dump.   To the point where: 
There are Cobwebs hanging from ceiling. 
Paint drips from the “fresh paint” throughout all rooms/halls. 
Burn marks on living room floor.  
Damaged trim around windows and doors and screens broken and ripped.  
Water damage over threshold doorway. 
Fridge still needing to be replaced from move in “renovation”. 
Holes in wall and cables randomly hanging out of holes etc.  
Gnarly first impression. 

Did not give us good vibes.   

We were also asked, before going to view the unit, to pay a pet deposit of $1200 (half months rent), along with half the months rent ($1200) (15th move in date pushed by the rental agency claiming the unit would be ready by then).   Not including the original damage deposit. 

So….  As of now we’re out of pocket $3600 plus all utilities hook up fees.  We did not sign the move in inspection or take possession of keys.    We wouldn’t be able to move in before the repairs are done regardless of the outcome. 

They’re offering us the damage deposit and pet deposit back, but want to keep the prorated rent.  Even though it was them who pushed the 15th move in date on an unfinished unit.   Also if the unit doesn’t rent for next month we’re on the hook for it until it does.

VictoriaBC,bargaindownhill,"In my opinion, very unethical practices at Oaklands vet clinic. My best buddy, who was literally born beside me in bed. Mommacat crawled under the covers to find the safest place she knew - beside the person who rescued her from a crackhouse that was being torn down. I was working for an electrical company called in to disconnect the power, and there she was, staring out from a broken drain pipe in the ground, very young and already pregnant.

I took her home and gave her a badly needed bath. Once I stopped the bleeding and bandaged my wounds, our journey of trust began.

Out of this skittish tiny cat came an even tinier little thing, blind and helpless. He grew rapidly into an enormous beast - we named him Kazinti MurderMittens.

He was always there, always comforting. On cold nights he would climb under the covers, snuggle up between my chest and arm, and vibrate softly. Hot summer nights he could be found sleeping next to my head, nose in my ear, his violent purr reassuring me that everything was okay. As someone working through PTSD, he was exactly what I seemed to need. He appeared to know what his job was instinctually.

He died today, and it seemed to not be the good death he may have deserved. You see, we had been taking our cats to Oakland's vet clinic since they opened, mainly because they were close. But today, in my opinion, they failed us massively. Today started like any day, Kazinti strolling up, nuzzling my ear at the correct wake-up time. We spent a few moments cuddling, him violently purring as usual - no sign of anything wrong. I stretched, gave him another pat and went off to the shower. As I was drying off I heard a racket - yowls of pain. I rushed to see what was wrong and he was in obvious distress. This all happened in the span of a quick 10 minute shower. He was wobbling up the steps, throwing up, literally screaming in pain. He went straight into his crate, which is only used for vet visits - it seemed like he was telling me ""I need help NOW!"".

Fumbling with my phone, I called Oakland's, the clinic we have used since he was born,  and the receptionist simply told us they were booked up and to call another clinic. In my opinion, that response was unsatisfactory. We continued calling, on hold, waiting for callbacks. Eventually a clinic told us about the Pacific Emergency Hospital. This was about 45 minutes of scrambling later, all the while Kazinti was getting worse.

It seems he had a stroke. The vets' consensus was there were treatments that could have been done had we gotten him there sooner, but his prognosis was not good by the time we arrived - too much delay. We had to do the only humane thing and take his pain away.

In my opinion, when you call a medical clinic and say you have chest pains or other symptoms, they will direct you to the nearest ER. I feel the same should be done at vet clinics. The fact the receptionist did not inform us about the emergency vet hospital makes me question their ethics and level of care for pets.

Anyways, today I was late and ended up behind the group, with one other person and had a harbour seal take great interest in us about the area of the small island. I was not trying to interact with it, but it wanted to interact with us. it was not aggressive in any way, it was just very chummy. swimming beside me, twirling under me, swimming right under me same speed. I could feel its whiskers on my side and gave me a few nudges (no teeth, much like a dog looking for pets) as it swam right beside me, nearly in body contact. I just kept on keeping on. It disappeared for a bit, but as we got within about 100m of the beach it was back, coming up behind us, and swimming under us right until we got to the beach. 

While the interaction was cool, and no one was injured or ever really threatened in any way I have questions. 

I know seals are protected species and you are not supposed to harass them but I'm not sure what to do then THEY want to interact with you. 

It seemed very curious rather than aggressive. but maybe I'm missing a cue? was it maybe protecting its territory? should I have bailed out of the swim(it would have been a rather sketchy rocky exit into someone's backyard) or was just continuing on as I was ok? 

there was nothing much I could have done about it at the time, the current set the plan, and there was no way to return to the beach I started from. Im seeking information on if there is anything else I need to know in these situations.

VictoriaBC,batikartist,"Trying to sublet with a messy landlord. Ideas? I'm not on the island, but I'm asking this for my brother who is:

So my brother is living in a rental unit with several other guys. All of them are hoping to sublet over the summer, but currently the property looks terrible because of their landlord.

The inside of the house is being maintained well enough but since the landlord has been performing renovations for a while the outside front yard and back yard have junk all over them, looking like a junk yard basically. It used to be a relatively beautiful house, but it just looks horrible and will likely be impossible to sublet, costing them each 600+$ per month over the summer if it can't be solved.

I couldn't find any similar situations in this sub and the landlord and tenant rights I could find in BC don't seem to cover this (there only seem to be rules for tenants keeping the property clean and for landlords to keep the actual house maintained). Their landlord seems to be fairly closed to criticism, and so I don't think a polite request or letter will work.

Does anyone have any experience with this, or ideas to terminate the lease early or to force him to clean up?

Edit: Thank you for the ideas and for the comments. I've since learned that the landlord has left his junk all over both yards since September 2017, despite promising for the whole time that it would be cleaned in 1-2 months. I'm not sure if all of them will be moving away in the summer, but either away I feel that they have some right to use their yards (at the moment the only things barely clear of junk are the paths), and I think it is written into their agreement that they have the use of the yards.
In regards to the subletting rules, I had assumed that based on where I lived (Alberta), where the landlord must allow a sublet unless they have reasonable grounds to do so, that it would be the same in BC.","BC Housing, Lived Experience",1,False,100.0

I’m a young 50 (if that makes sense), active, single woman so I’ll want to be able to make some friends and social connections. I do have a daughter who goes to UVic which is nice. As a single woman, the cost of living anywhere on the island is tough so I will be renting, likely a condo in a spot that’s safe, not too loud or busy with traffic. (Good luck, I know.) I see a lot of rentals in Westshore neighbourhoods and have seen some reasonable ones in the Brentwood Bay area. These may be a bit far from downtown Victoria depending on where I end up working and they also may mean I’m less likely to meet other single people. (I currently live around a lot of seniors and while I absolutely adore them, I’m not going to be dating them. Lol) I also have a dog. I’m hoping to find a community that has trails and beaches nearby. My tendency has always been to be a bit out of town but that may not serve me well with this move.

VictoriaBC,beans_CA,"A single resident in a one bedroom apartment working minimum wage full-time will only have $121.34 left over after rent once taxes are accounted for in Victoria. Greetings, humans. I hope you are well.

Recently, [there was a post on this sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/wq9y3k/rent_for_a_onebedroom_home_in_victoria_averages/) which stated that the average rent for a single bedroom apartment in Victoria was $2,107 per month. With this revelation, I was curious how much money a single person working minimum wage for 40 hours per week would have left over after rent. So, I did some math.

Please note: I am neither a mathematician, nor a finance / taxation expert, so please let me know if I have gotten something incorrect here. If I have gotten this right, please let me know as well.

So [minimum wage in BC is currently $15.65 per hour](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standards/wages/minimum-wage). Assuming 40 hours worked per week, that works out to $626 earned per week, and with about 4 weeks in a month, that means $2,504 earned in a month. Now initially, subtracting the stated average rent from this figure makes it seem as though one would have $397 extra to spend on things like food, etc. While certainly not great, it seems that one might be able to just barely, *barely* squeeze by with that amount left over (assuming that no accidents happen and that they don't need to pay for dental work and that they really, *really* like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches).

BUT, this isn't the full story. Because taxes (and other deductions).

Most jobs in Canada have 3 different deductions: Employment Insurance (EI), Canada Pension Plan (CPP), and Taxes. Let's go through these one by one to see how much money one loses over a year. To start, we need the total annual salary of a minimum wage worker, which is our previous $626 / week multiplied over the 52 weeks that any given year has, or $32,552 / year.

Start with EI. [EI is deducted at a rate of 1.58% from an entire salary up to $60,300](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/payroll-deductions-contributions/employment-insurance-ei/ei-premium-rates-maximums.html). Obviously, a minimum wage worker doesn't make anywhere near that, so in our case that will be deducted from the entire salary. 32,552 x 0.0158 works out to **$514.32** deducted total for EI.

Next, CPP. [This one is deducted at a rate of 5.7% up to $61,400](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/payroll-deductions-contributions/canada-pension-plan-cpp/cpp-contribution-rates-maximums-exemptions.html), however unlike EI, $3,500 of any salary is exempt from this deduction. So, we subtract $3,500 from our total salary of $32,552 to get $29,052 deductable for EI. 29,052 x 0.057 works out to **$1,655.96** deducted total for CPP.

Now, taxes. Assuming that one doesn't have any other credits or deductions, every Canadian citizen is given a tax credit, called the Basic Personal Amount. [In 2022, this is $14,398](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/federal-government-budgets/basic-personal-amount.html) which is exempt from taxation. Subtracting this from our salary of $32,552 gives us $18,154 total taxable. Now, this falls in the lowest income brackets both in BC and in Canada as a whole, giving taxation rates of [5.06% and 15% respectively](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/frequently-asked-questions-individuals/canadian-income-tax-rates-individuals-current-previous-years.html), or 20.06% all together. 18,154 x 0.2006 works out to **3641.69** deducted total for taxes.

Finally, to put it all together we subtract all of our deductions from our initial salary in order to get our actual salary in a year.

$32,552 - $514.32 - $1,655.96 - $3641.69 = **26,740.03 per year, or $2,228.34 per month**.

Subtracting our previously stated average rent of $2,107, and **one is left with $121.34 total left over per month for everything else.**

I don't know about you folks, but this doesn't exactly seem sustainable.

VictoriaBC,bedoublenegative,"Restaurants and Covid-19 Protocols/Enforcement Not sure if this exists yet but I’ve been seeking a list of local restaurants/pubs/cafes and their pandemic protocols (such a staff enforcement, mask wearing, consistency, contact tracing, etc.) as well as any changes to regular service/menus.

If anyone is willing to share, I’ll try to keep this list updated as best as I can.

Current Orders in BC affecting Restaurants (hotels/tasting rooms/breweries may be exempt) can be found here:[https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirus](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirus)

Highlights of Provincial Orders (subject to change)

* 6 person max at tables - household bubble only (no changing tables for larger groups, no congregating)
* Mask required inside when not eating or drinking (required when walking to restroom, etc)
* Reduced capacity
* 2 Metre distance between patrons unless separated by physical barriers
* Patrons must remain seated (unless using facilities)
* Musicians need physical barriers between them and guests (plexi usually)

**Note:** This is all based on actual individual experiences. Please be aware that it isn't gospel. Visit at your own risk and contact the establishments for up to date info.

VictoriaBC,binky_snoosh,"thinking about moving to Victoria (general questions) This would be a move ""back"" to BC.

I'm currently in Manitoba, but I grew up in the Fraser Valley.  The wife and I are thinking about moving back to BC to be closer to family.  We've spent the last 6 years away in Manitoba (4 year) and Ontario (2 years).  The lack of family is starting to grate on my wife... the distance is nice for me.  So, to compromise... we'd like to move closer for her, and not so close for me.

so... a couple of questions for the people that live there.

* **Accommodations:** seems like house prices are in the $400K+ range, but lots of them seem to have suites.  I read something about them legalizing the ""inlaw/nanny"" suites... is this true?  If the house is listing one of those it's legal, and you're able to rent it out?

* **Accommodations:** having lived in Abbotsford, and Winnipeg (two of the latest Murder capitals of Canada)...  what's the crime like?  I was reading another [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/hyoqe/my_map_of_victorias_socioeconomic_regions_ive/) about the different socioeconomic regions there and Esquimalt seems to be the worst part (other than a little patch downtown)

* **Accommodations:** What's the vacancy rates like for finding rentals... or buying and renting a suite?

* **Kids:**  I've got two kids (9 and 7)... what are the schools like?  I'm not going to ask about the activities for them, as I'm assuming they are like every other city soccer in the summer, skating in the winter (granted, you guys don't get much snow and/or cold)

* **Work:** I tried to find work there 6 years ago, and from what I could gather, it was 75% ""who"" you know...  is this still the case, or is it an easier process to apply for work there now?  I'd be looking towards the IT side of things (development, databases, consulting, etc.)

So, I have been living in my current place since 2018 and up until the last year everything has been relatively fine (on my end at least lol). I have always paid rent EARLY and in full, never had any issues. However, my landlord is an alcoholic and goes on rampages sometimes where she sends me nasty text messages and threatens to evict me for illegal reasons.

About a month ago, she served me an illegal eviction notice with countless bogus reasons (I am not worried though because I already filed a dispute claim and have mountains of evidence to contradict everything). The problem is our court date isn't until May and she has taken to constantly harassing me and sending me threatening text messages. 

I am not sure if I just have to suck it up and continue gathering evidence while waiting for my court date, or if there are other avenues I can explore. Not really sure if what she's doing is ""criminal"" persay?

VictoriaBC,bms42,"Enough rail nonsense - let's get practical The E&N rail corridor is every LRT nut's obsession, but can we be realistic about this for a moment?  The line is in major disrepair.  It runs straight through one of the busiest intersections in the western commnities.  It has many, many level crossings elsewhere.  The route now terminates short of the downtown bus hub by a couple hundred feet of water.

Despite all this, I'm not at all against *some* use of this corridor, but let's be practical about it.  Someone (sorry I forget the name) wrote a letter to a local paper promoting the use of buses on the corridor.  This strikes me as a great idea.  Here's why:

- cheap.  cheap cheap cheap.  Do you know how much easier it would be to remove the rail ties and pave this than to restore the rail bed?

- flexible:  Yes it's only wide enough for one way traffic, but you could run buses into town in the morning, out of town in the evening and of course you can use the existing road network to complete the return trips.  So the bus travels along its own dedicated corridor into town in the morning, then circles back to langford on the highway through the lighter traffic.  Opposite in the evening.

- feeder network: buses wouldn't all have to start and stop at ""terminals"".  You could have 4 different buses that all collect in different parts of the west shore before getting onto the corridor, just like ""real"" bus service.

- efficient/safe level crossings: the buses on the corridor could be run in clusters, with 3 or 4 trailing each other closely.  this way you shut down traffic at the level crossings less frequently.  Because buses are road-vehicle size, the crossings don't have to be shut down with the same lead/lag times as train crossings.  It's simply not as dangerous as running an unstoppable train through a road network.

- scalable: you can add/remove buses to the circuit without the capital costs of adding new train cars.

- maintainable: guess what?  We already have a bus service center in Victoria.  Crazy eh?

Before I get too noisy about promoting this idea, am I missing anything?  Thoughts from the community?

EDIT:  some additional points from /u/danma, with a bit of my own editorializing:

- self-managed: By removing this from the hands of the various rail agencies, local governments can manage it, instead of having various agencies at play (VIA, ICF, Transport Canada etc etc)

- Bridge issue: Although I hinted at this above, to be clear: This addresses the fact that the new blue bridge doesn't have a rail crossing as the buses can hop off the rail and right into town in the mornings

- CFB Esquimalt:  the train would leave you with a ~2km walk to the base itself. A bus could pop off and go right to the destination and back via Admirals at Colville.",Point in Time,0,False,26.923076923076923
VictoriaBC,bms42,"Property assessment myth buster thread I see that the property assessment doom squad is out again, so let's dispel a few myths shall we?

**Myth 1: when my assessment goes up my taxes go up.**

BUSTED!  In fact, if yours went up LESS than the average across your municipality then your taxes may go DOWN.  More specifically the portion of the overall tax collected by the municipality will go down.  Of course your actual amount owed may still go up but that will be because the municipality may choose to collect more this year.

To understand this you need to Google ""property tax mill rate"".  Essentially the city decides how much revenue they need for next year, and they divide that by the total value of all properties in the city.  The result is a ""tax $ per thousand dollars of property value"".  You pay that.

**Myth 2:. The city (actually province) artificially over values properties to collect more money.**

BUSTED!  Nope.  The city sets a budget and they will collect the needed revenue regardless of the property assessments. See ""Mill rate"" above.

I swear, every morning I drive in, I witness bumper-to-bumper eastbound traffic spanning from Admirals all the way to McCallum, and vice versa on the drive home. This seems like the tip of the iceberg though, considering horrendous traffic up Veterans towards the hwy at all hours of the day, compounded by every other arterial route being blocked off by roadwork or construction (wonder whose bright idea it was to have all of those projects run simultaneously.)

The question I gotta ask is, has it always been this bad? My point of reference is limited having only gotten familiar with the area in the last 5 years, but it feels like the Westshore exploded in population without any sort of foresight to plan infrastructure and developments to account for it. The transit is subpar, barely any accomodations are made for bicycles and the like, and suburban sprawl takes precedent over any chance to build up multi-use buildings and actually save space/reduce the need for everyone to drive.

We're in a small apartment building in Saanich, and it really shouldn't be that difficult for them to do the installation...

Does anyone know a way around this, or know if they tend to overestimate the wait times?  I was hoping to only have to wait 1-2 days prior to installation since I work from home and need internet available to do so.

Coming from Oak Bay, I decided to take Yates St.  Due to construction east of Quadra, Yates is down to one lane and was very backed up, so I took a detour by going right on Vancouver and right again on Johnson.

Johnson was down to one lane due to construction, so I took a right on Cook.

Cook was down to one lane due to construction, but I persevered and ended up taking a right on Fairfield.

Fairfield was down to one lane (alternating) due to construction, but I was almost at my destination so I planned to take a right on Quadra.

Quadra was down to one lane due to construction, and very busy, so I decided to go another block to Blanshard and then go right on Fort.

Fort is _not_ down to one lane, but the only 2 parking spots left on the block were closed off… presumably due to construction.  

I went left on Quadra and left again on View, which was clear until Blanshard, but then I ran into construction in the next block. 😂

Specifically at the bell between the 6th and 7th holes, which is said to conjure spirits if rung 3 times.

The tragic story of Doris Gravlin, commonly referred to as ""The April Ghost"" and her estranged husband Victor is the primary source of history behind this famously haunted location (see full story and excerpt below) of which many of you have probably come across on one of Victoria's ""Ghostly Walks"".

The photo collection shows the unaltered darker image of the apparition between the bell and its post. The other photo is an unaltered higher contrast version better showing the creepy face!

Excerpt from the full story of Doris and Victor Gravlin via [https://seeksghosts.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-ghost-of-doris-gravlin.html](https://seeksghosts.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-ghost-of-doris-gravlin.html)

""Doris Gravlin was a private nurse and was married to Victor Gravlin who wrote sports news for the *Colonist* newspaper in Victoria. The couple had a seven-year-old son Walter who went by the nickname, Robin. \*   
Despite the fact, these two loved each other their marriage was not a happy one. When Victor lost his job at the newspaper in 1934, due to illness most likely connected to alcoholism, Doris separated from him.

The young couple, Doris was thirty and Victor was in his mid-thirties tried several times to get back together but nothing ever seemed to work out for them.   
In September of 1936, Victor arranged to meet with his wife at the Victoria Golf Course after work. The pair liked to walk to the Oak Bay Beach Hotel, a favourite spot to eat from this location. His parents stated afterward that he was hoping for a reconciliation.

What happened next will never be known. Both were seen alive for the last time early that evening. Victor was seen leaving his home and the elderly lady who Doris cared for, bid goodbye to her early, so she could be on time.   
Two days later the couple’s respective parents reported them missing. On Sunday a caddy discovered Doris’ beaten and strangled body on the beach. A large club like piece of driftwood lay near her body.

Victor Gravlin had disappeared. A search team was organized which included a local boy scout troop. A month later, Victor was found. A fisherman discovered his body floating offshore near the golf course tangled in some kelp. Doris’ shoes, which were not on her body when she was found, were in Victor’s pocket.   
The case was recorded as a murder-suicide and then closed.

Within a few short months people began to report a strange sight on the Victoria Golf Course. Here is one account told by Charles Lillard and Robin Skelton about an  early sighting:

*“A fisherman fishing off the rocky shore of Gonzalez Point, the section of the Victoria Golf Links containing both the seventh green and ninth tee, was one of the first Victorian’s to see Doris Gravlin after her death…*

*The fisherman was unable to say what made him turn around and look up at the bank and the green. But he did, and a  
*woman was staring out toward the kelp beds. She paid him no attention whatsoever, even though she was only a few feet away. He could not immediately understand why she was there.*

*The light was fading fast, and all the fisherman noted, besides the gloomy look on her face, was what he later described ‘as an old-fashioned brown suit.’ The suit stuck in his mind because Oak Beach was, then and now, one of Victoria’s most beautiful suburbs, and hardly a place where a young woman ignored fashion.*

*He continued casting. She said nothing. He said nothing, and ‘then she suddenly hurried down as if she was going to meet someone, and on the way she vanished.’ The fisherman stated, “I saw her kind of melt away.”*

Over the years there have been many more sightings of Doris. She appears year-round on the course, but she seems to prefer the month of March. It is said she appears in the late afternoon more “human-like” but dressed in old- fashioned clothes walking around the course.   
She is known to leave footprints in the bunkers. But when she is seen at night, she takes on a more ethereal appearance. After dark, she is seen most often on the green closest to the ocean.

It is a rite of passage for the young people in Victoria to go to this golf course at night to search for Doris’ ghost.   
One legend associated with her haunting, states that if you ring the brass bell located between the sixth and seventh holes three times, it will summon her ghost. No one knows why she is connected to this bell, but it is speculated that Victor might have rung it the night they disappeared.""",Alcoholic ,0,False,0.0

Hi all,

My best friend just had 2 strokes 2 weeks ago and thankfully, has been treated AH-MAZING-LY at the RJH. Thank you to all the nurses and Specialists for taking care of her so well!! It was incredible!

My friend was just discharged from the hospital and because of her strokes, has had significant weakness in her mobility and use of her right side. So meal cooking and prep or grocery shopping is not an option for her. I will be staying with her for the next couple months, to help her in her recovery process but we are on VERY different diets. She needs a no-salt/low salt/ low protein diet and I need a high salt/moderate-high protein based diet. We both have heart conditions but both are polar opposite in its treatment obviously.

So instead of having to cook 2 totally separate meals for us ( I am a full-time student currently in College), I am looking for a specific meal delivery service that can provide Low-Sodium Meals. I tried googling it, but so far have come up with no delivery services. Does anyone know specifically if there is anything like this in Victoria?

I have a knowledge in medicine and have a history of chronic kidney infections since age 7. So i know what antibiotics tend to kick it and so i phoned to 4 different pharmacies (good luck getting through to pharmacy at london drugs first thing in the morning). Both London Drugs ramg and then a voice message said ""all team members are currently busy please try your call again"". I called one Shoppers Drug Mart that told me you had to book an appointment to see the pharmacist for the ""minor ailments"" perscription advising program. Finally found out Hillside Mall Shoppers takes walk in consults with Pharmacists for minor ailments. Lied and told him i had a UTI so he would perscribe a course of antibiotics and specifially asked for the ones I am normally perscribed. He didnt even ask me more thab 2 questions about symptoms before perscribing. 

All i got to say is holy crap! How the hell has it become so bloody bad that Urgent Care which is supposed to relieve the ER, is at capacity 5 minutes after opening! Seriously. I cant imagine what would happen if my kid was still little and got an ear infection or strep throat and needed antibiotics..

We get there five minutes prior to our appointment time and check in and wait. 10 minutes passes.and then another 5 and and another 5 and finally I asked the receptiomist if she knew how much lomger the Dr would be delayed. She told me he was running behind and would be 10 more minutes. I explained that my husband came on his lunchbreak and only had 30 minutes for the appointment so she was aware we needed to be seen shortly or we would have to leave.

CampVI is a Vancouver Island camping guidebook brought to life and built to serve users anywhere, anytime.

He is a lazy, sweet, and very loving 7.5 year-old German Shepherd. For personal reasons (see below), I am aware that I won't be able to look after him like he deserves, and I need to be proactive.

I've spoken with my veterinary hospital, made posts on UsedVictoria and the classified ads in the Times Colonist, I've reached out to several different rescues (Rain Coast Dogs, The Farm, Flirting with Fido, Broken Promises), and posted in a Rehoming Pets community on Facebook.

I have one or two inquiries from my posts, most of the rescues are either sympathetic but too busy, or will only communicate if I push my dog out the door apparently. I understand they are doing their best, but it feels like only reactionary issues are dealt with instead of proactive efforts.

I presently have time and availability to set up meet and greets, to do interviews, to see how things fit, and by no means will I let him go to anything but an ideal situation for his own well-being, but finding anyone to connect with is absurdly difficult.

Any local or other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

As for my personal circumstances, I've lived in Greater Victoria for almost 6 years. I'm going through a divorce, and when March comes around, I am being required to physically return to work. Resources are tight, and I no longer have my own vehicle.

The return to work mandate was the last straw, and I won't be able to responsibly look after my dog with the love and care that he deserves. My family connections are out of province, and my social circles are small.

VictoriaBC,candrie,"Family having weird Passport experience - looking for insight. (X-Post /r/Canada) Preface: My mom and I are taking a trip (I'm 40, she's almost 80), and she has had the most - well is having - unbelievable passport experience... And I was hoping to hear at least similar tales of woe so I can calm her a bit.

My mom has traveled a lot.  Cruised the world in fact.  Thousands of hours, tons of trips.  She let her passport expire, because she had a knee injury and thought she may not travel again.

She decided that her and I should do a mother daughter cruise together for my 41st birthday (start of May).  She mailed off her passport application in February.  

They sent it back with all her documents, saying she needed her marriage certificate.  

She sent that all back.

They **KEPT** all her documents, and called her saying that no, not that marriage, the one from 60 years ago.  

That marriage was short, insignificant, and over 59 years ago, and she was married to my dad for 30 years.

She contacted vital statistics, and they said they found it, and would send it on.  Now she has a letter saying yea, can't find it.

It is now April.

The cruise is less than a month away.

And even if she can get the documents from Vital Stats, she can't go in person to Passport Canada because they KEPT ALL HER DOCS!

She is - in the way only her generation can - freaking out.  Asking for me to write a letter pleading for a rush; which we know they won't read.

I am just hoping for some reddit love and success stories I can send her way to help her feel better, and alleviate her fears.

She kept talking about this trip as her last hurrah, and I hope its not... But, she is devastated, and I want to make her feel better.  So any Reddit Love/Advice is what the doctor (or daughter) ordered.

Thanks everyone.

TLDR:  Passport Canada wants my 80 year old mom to provide a 60 year old marriage cert (that they never needed previously) and kept her documents so she can't go in person! 

Edit 1 - Day 1 Follow up:
I got home from work, and had an inbox full of crazy!  Anyway, I wanted to touch base now that i have talked to my mom.

She asserts the issue is resolved, but her definition of 'resolved' is loose at best.

According to passport Canada they now have the document - miraculously found, but they made her pay a rush fee to try and get it to her by the 15th - no guarantee. 

They have made no promises, no statement of accuracy or correctness of the document, just that 'they have it', which we have heard twice before.

My issue currently (because I understand bureaucracy, and they can't guarantee anything) is the time it took, the fact they retained her documents, and now, because they retained the documents, and she cannot go in person, she is forced to pay a rush fee... Which feels (I know not accurate, but I love drama) like ransom to me!

I know she feels it resolved, but until it is in her hand, &/or we are on our cruise I remain unconvinced.

We will see.

Any-who, I thought you deserved a follow up on my moms idea of 'resolved'.

I am going to reach out to our MP Elizabeth May to see if there is something she can do, because I don't think I could take my moms tears if they tell her 'oh yea sorry we need ___' one more time.  I asked my mom to go, but she feels its okay now - despite it really not being okay.

I tell you what though, I have learned it doesn't matter if you have an old painful marriage form 60 years ago, in 2015 you keep those papers!

> They said they don’t take cats from my area, but lent me a carrier and sent me to the Animal Control off Gorge. Over I went and the woman flat out said they do not take cats from my area, that there was no where that took Saanich cats at all. Despite telling her that he had been trapped under my house, she looked at him and said he probably wasn’t starving, was just thin and told me to take him back to where I found him and release him. The poor little guy was obviously starving and when I asked her if she could at least give me a little food for  him she sighed and said she would look, then proceeded to go  into the office and start gossiping with another person in there and never came back out.
 

Has anyone heard of this?

As a cat owner who lives in Sannich, I would like to think that if my poor cat got out, that someone would take her in, see the tattoo etc so my cat could be reunited with me.

As a pet lover I was furious to know people were being told to just - let them go!

This story has a happy ending as my friend found the owner on Used Victoria, but hearing that Sannich cats are being refused shelter is super upsetting to me, especially knowing if my cat some how got out, got lost and someone found her, they would be told just to let her go!

I have been going to vestibular rehab but am about to be discharged from the physiotherapist-- I am testing as someone with a brain injury/lesion/concussion-like symptoms beyond my inner ear damage and that's outside their scope and am not progressing as I would be with a straight vestibular issue.

I've been advised to seek a neurologist or ENT referral and go from there -- I'm attempting to do that through walk in clinics and telehealth but it's a slow process trying to be seen in person and not dismissed. 

To make the most out of each contact with a Healthcare professional I'm wondering if anyone has advice on routes to try. 

- I don't Officially have a brain injury diagnosis so I don't think the Brain Injury Society is appropriate for me to reach out to.
- I can get through daily life if I don't push it too hard but I can't do most of my active hobbies; I'm not sure a referral to a neurologist or ENT would be accepted as I am not debilitated by these issues, it's just a diminished quality of life and others would (appropriately) be triaged much higher. I am happy to go to Vancouver if needed as i imagine there are more specialists there.
- Long covid clinic referral? I don't have the normal physical or cognitive symptoms (e.g. brain fog) so I don't think I have long covid but that is what started all this. 
- a different vestibular therapist? I think most vestibular physios would have the same limitations to their scope of practice but I do see Neuromotion exists which covers both vestibular issues and brain injuries. Any experiences with Neuromotion physios?
- I see there's a Balance and Dizziness Clinic in town -- any experiences there?
- I have seen an optometrist who diagnosed me with double vision from this but can't determine the mechanism causing it. Would a neuro optometrist be able to provide any further info?
- I have gone for a hearing exam and I have no hearing loss and a healthy middle ear/eardrum.

VictoriaBC,chamekke,"How to stop balcony door from icing shut due to condensation? (coming cold snap) I rent an apartment whose balcony door has never quite closed. (The track was slightly warped when we moved in a few years ago, and it's never been fixed.) As a result, in wintertime it gets a lot of condensation, as well as stiff drafts (even when ""closed"") when the wind is easterly. To keep our place warmer, we tend to close the drapes, but that just makes the condensation worse.

This becomes more problematic during cold snaps, when the water in the runners turns to ice. I wouldn't care about it freezing shut - except that we have a hummingbird feeder! So, we need to open the door periodically to take out the nectar, especially just before dawn. Even sugar water will freeze at -4 ... and the Victoria weather reports are calling for nighttime lows between -5 and -9 over the next four nights!

Any suggestions? In the past I've used towels to sop up the moisture, wringing them out and replacing them. I've also used a blowdryer to melt the ice, and we've even sloshed hot water onto the track (which gets very messy) to speed up the melting. None of these is ideal.

(Before anyone suggests it ... we don't have an outdoor electrical outlet so we can't rig up any kind of heater for the feeder itself. In the past I've tried taping hand warmer packets to the underside, but that really hasn't helped a lot. And cladding is difficult as it's a saucer-style feeder. The most reliable solution is to take the feeder in at night, then put it out again before dawn.)

"" Alcohol was a factor in a fall from the Johnson Street Bridge that left a man seriously injured on Saturday, police say.

Victoria police were called to the area about 11:40 p.m. and found the man injured on the ground below the bridge. They initially said it appeared the man leaned on the railing and somehow fell to the ground below.

 It’s at least the second incident involving someone falling from the bridge. In December, a man died after falling into the water. Police said the man, who was intoxicated, lost his balance while climbing on the bridge’s railing.

City staff say the bridge’s railing meets safety standards, and its safety systems are better than those for the previous bridge. “Safety systems are generally designed for normal use, not necessarily to prevent a determined person who wants to get around them,” said city spokesman Bill Eisenhauer.

Eisenhauer said the city will review “all relevant details” to determine if any action is required.""

We received a notice last week from his school that there was an exposure in his class room on two separate dates, 5 days apart from each other. It said there was no need to isolate or get tested but to just monitor for symptoms. It’s been about 10 days since the last date listed and he has developed some symptoms. 

I called this morning at 8am and received a call back at 9am, they booked him in to be tested at the Victoria conference centre downtown for 3pm the same day. 

It is not a drive through site, so you go and park under the conference centre. They have lots of parking spaces marked for covid testing, you walk back outside and up the side and into one of the glass pavilion type things. You line up and go into one of the booths they have set up. He had the swish and gargle test, but they said on the phone it would depend if they had that test in stock. Which leads me to believe he could have had the nasal swab. 

They said it’s 24-48 hours for results. It was mostly kids with their parents waiting to be tested. Just wanted to share the experience because I was surprised that they were testing at the conference centre like that.

VictoriaBC,ckris292,"Viable help for young crack addict? I need advice on how to *save* a crack addict.

This person is a valuable human being, before and now. A young, beautiful person, and very smart.

They have recently progressed to a full-blown crack cocaine addiction, and is now homeless and prostituting themselves, in a situation of maximum harm and risk you can imagine. 

Although the damage and wear of many sleepless nights is starting to show, they remain smart, coherent and beautiful. You can see the kindness and humanity coming through their fiending. They basically are like any of your sons or daughters, and had a bright future.

It feels like I'm watching someone slowly die. They show the standard predatory/manipulative behavior, driven by the addiction, but they lack signs of an underlying personality disorder (No sign of NPD, BPD, etc.). They have patterns of denial and rationalization, but these patterns are fairly coherent. I've not been exploited or preyed upon by this person.

So, what are my options here in Victoria?

1. **Arrest/imprisonment:** Is it viable to get them arrested or imprisoned, thus forcing them into a rehabilitation program? What's the vice squad situation in Victoria, will they just be put through a funnel and spat out? Note: they have coherent, credible stories of sex with police officers.
2. **Massive ""Intervention""**: I don't feel like taking a few weeks off work to commit multiple felonies, but this is life and death. I want to kidnap them and put them in a place where they can chill out. Problem is, I'll need ""something"" for them, or they'll die of withdrawal and hate me. Also, they will hate me.
3. **Voluntary Program:** I guess I'm could talk them into a voluntary program (??). Ok. What is the quality of the programs and how will I go about doing this? Obviously, I expect this to require many attempts, relapses, drama, but it's still worthy.

I'm looking for advice from the initiated. For example, a naive thought might be to give them shelter and money, but this alone is very unlikely to work. They will just see you as a source, gain knowledge, and escalate demands until you are exasperated and leave them.

Of all the topics I've seen here, this seems like the most important, life and death situation, where one individual (me), isn't able or equipped to help alone. There are many addicts that are worn out, and structurally fucked up, and the truth is, we don't care about them.

I'm desperately looking for any kind catlover(s) to take in my cat, Sophie, while all the flooring is replaced in the apartment I rent.  We weren't exactly sure when it was happening, but my landlord just confirmed our move out day is November 13th, so time is of the essence!

I was lucky enough to find a place for myself and my young daughter, but unfortunately it doesn't allow cats.  I've considered kennels, but aside from being ridiculously expensive and booked far in advance this time of year, I've heard horror stories about pets going to one and never coming home.  I'd much prefer to find a trustworthy home for Sophie (16f) to stay.  I've also looked into that ROVER app, but it seems pretty hit-or-miss (and also super expensive for a month-long stay).

She's a pretty chill cat -- she likes attention and pettings, but mostly just prefers to lounge about.  She's short-haired with trimmed nails, and has been an indoor cat her whole life.  Scratching furniture, etc, has never been an issue, and due to her age/laziness, she's unable to jump up on anything.  Aside from a bald spot on her side due to age, she's in really good health for such an old gal.

Here's what I can provide: (\*=optional based on your space/preference)

* small cat bed (for on the floor)
* all food (wet + dry, treats and feeding dishes)
* Almost brand new litter box with litter (introduced it yesterday so she could get used to it)
* Cat grass weekly\*
* Litter locker\* (basically a container with a trap door for scooped litter)
* Large cat tree\* (18""x18""x36""... but honestly, she rarely uses it as she can't climb up)

I'll be staying in the Hillside area, but will be travelling to Esquimalt/Vic West daily to take my daughter to preschool.  If you live in that area (or really anywhere accessible by transit) I would be happy to drop by a few times a week to scoop the litter box or give her some attention.

I'm a single mom in the process of returning to work (I had my daughter a few months before COVID and then moved here from Vancouver a year later) so I'm certainly not rich.  However, I'll scrape together everything I can to compensate you financially.  I'm sure we can discuss it and come to some agreement that works for you (and a bit of extra money right before the holidays never hurts!)

If you think you could help, please reach out!  Even some advice on different options would be much appreciated!  Sophie has been with me for 12+ years (after being bounced around between houses for her first few years), and she's gotten me through some pretty rough times, so I just want to do right by her now.  Hopefully there's someone out there who can help!

(Please note: apologies if it don't respond right away, but I'm frantically trying to pack up my whole place in 4 days by myself.  I'll be sure to check back at least a few times a day, though!)

Edited Fri morning: Wow!  I can't believe how many amazingly kind and helpful people there are here! Thank you so much for your responses!  
I've received a number of DM's that I'll try to respond to today or tomorrow.  I'm just trying to plow through some packing today as it's the last day my daughter is at preschool, but I'll try to reach out as soon as I can.  Thank you everyone -- I feel so relieved knowing she has a few options!

The province is currently at the negotiating table hammering out a new deal with BC physicians.  I don't know what the specific steps are to fix this mess, but it's fair to say it's going to take a lot of different approaches to fix this problem.

I know it's relatively meaningless, but... write a letter.  Your MLA, your mayor, your MP, the media.  Only the provincial government has jurisdiction, but we need cooperation from everyone to try and figure this out.

Tell them your story. Tell them how this problem impacts you.  Share your concerns, your thoughts, and your ideas.  If you're feeling plucky, tell them you pay attention to elections and you're going to vote based on their progress and promises on this file.

Yes, paying for new programs and better compensation for primary care providers is an issue.  But tell them that, too.  That this is important, and if you're willing to pay more in taxes, say it.

I'm convinced the only way this gets fixed is if it is a noisy problem, and if those who are without basic healthcare access refuse to be quiet about it.  Universal Healthcare without access isn't universal at all, and we all deserve better.

This sucks, and it will take many years before we see an improvement.  But immediate action CAN stop  the situation from getting worse.

VictoriaBC,coffeebean2551,"Moving to Victoria... Neighborhood & real estate feedback? Partner has landed a very good job downtown, me not so much but cashflow wise we're fine. Looking to buy a house but not interested in a long commute. Have been looking at real estate on the web but we can't get to Victoria for a month or so and online is no substitute for inperson. It would be great to hear your thoughts on:
- a good buyers realtor... Our last one sucked and we ended up overpaying
- Neighborhoods you enjoy with an easy commute to downtown. Always tradeoffs I know, but we currently have a 20 min commute by car, a lot with comfortable outdoor space, plenty of services within easy walking distance and good transit access. Looking to not give up too many of these assets. A shorter commute be great as would a good bike commute.
Would like to be under a million if possible 😉

VictoriaBC,coko74,"Land Deal Not Good for Students at Vic High SD61 is proposing to dispose of land behind Vic High School.  This was communicated to the community as a requirement of the seismic upgrades for the school with no consultation.  This is NOT the case.

What you may not know is the impacts this will have to Victoria High School and its student population - 38% less land for students within the downtown core.  Student needs are not being considered as part of this land decision. A group of parents and concerned citizens are working together on behalf of students today and into the future to present facts and ensure that land is retained for academic purposes or learning opportunities.

There are HUGE pressures in the SD61 school system.  Many of the schools are overcrowded and at capacity.  The City of Victoria is growing without the infrastructure to support it.  This is the only high school within the district expected to manage that growth.  It’s just not feasible to expect the developments in the downtown core to put this much pressure on our schools (elementary and middle feeder schools too).

Come listen to a brief presentation on what we have discussed with SD61 to date.  Ask questions and share your concerns.  We want to move forward with positive and creative ideas.

We are holding TWO information sessions with the same message to ensure you and your neighbours have the opportunity to attend.

VictoriaBC,colenski999,"Pulled over by the Sidney RCMP - because I am a man?!? Last night, I was driving my wife's car, with her in it, to our boat on Land's End Road. As we drove down the Pat Bay to Land's End, an RCMP car came out of nowhere to pull us over. What the heck, I thought, I wasn't speeding or anything, so whatever. The RCMP member comes to the window, and says ""I am Constable so and so from the Sidney RCMP and the reason I am pulling you over is because this car is registered to a female, and you are not a female.""

&#x200B;

I was so shocked by how ridiculous this was, and my only response was to silently point at my wife in the passenger seat. My wife explained that this was her car, and that I was insured to drive it (I am) - the cop proceeds to take my drivers license and asks me some confusing questions like what is the postal code on my DL, in an effort, I assume, to trick me into incriminating myself somehow, then leaves us to chill in the car for about 15 minutes while he ran my DL through every database he had access to. After 15 minutes he gets bored or whatever and hands me back the DL and tells me I am good to go. Reddit, here are my questions:

&#x200B;

1. I understand probable cause, but what I do not understand is how if a male is driving a female's car or vice-versa, how can that constitute probable cause? What if I am borrowing the car? Ridiculous extreme, what if I am transitioning?

&#x200B;

2. At no time did the member ask for registration, proof of ownership, or ID from my wife. How did the member know that the car was legitimately my wife's?

&#x200B;

3. Personally I feel this was an abuse of authority. Is this worth pursuing in a formal complaint to the RCMP, or is this just another ""cops go on fishing expedition"" thing that would be ignored?

\[EDIT\] I found this link that explains it pretty well: [https://www.michaeldyck.ca/blog/2020/12/1/what-should-you-not-do-during-a-traffic-stop](https://www.michaeldyck.ca/blog/2020/12/1/what-should-you-not-do-during-a-traffic-stop)

Basically they can go fishing at any point in time.

\[EDIT2\] More context:

1. I am white, my wife is a POC but she's so short I doubt the cop could see her while we were driving.
2. Brand new car, a Ford Flex.
3. Yes I have a boat, but it's the 2nd worst boat in the marina so I would hardly call myself rich.
4. blah blah white privilege - i resent that. I don't want ANYBODY to be pulled over on fishing expeditions, but apparently with the concessions given to the RCMP on cannabis laws, they have the right now to pull over anyone for made up reasons. And, the male / female not matching the registration is a SPECIFIC exemption.
5. I learned that the cop is allowed to ask the name and address of someone that is not the driver of the car but in the car, but that is all. You don't have to show ID, which is why point 2 above.
6. Overall this seems to be an example of the police following the letter of the law but not the spirit of the law. All of the ferries on Sunday had left by then, so i doubt he could have been profiling for human trafficking, where would I go? ",Point in Time,0,False,0.0

VictoriaBC,confuzed_1,"Densification We (40m/35f) purchased a home 2 years ago in Fernwood. I realize we are privileged, and lucky, with two high paying jobs, and having started investing/saving young.

I want to start by saying: many/most  don’t get the same opportunities, and may never get a ‘break’. My heart breaks, and I simply don’t know how to help.

I personally wish we knew how to help. We float the idea constantly about building a tiny house in the backyard, or lifting the house and build a suite. Just to be able yo add one extra housing opportunity on the market. The inventory (and the quality of the rental places) is abysmal. Many of our friends rent, and are being priced out of the market. It’s only getting worse every year.

Having a single dwelling house 10k around downtown core seems wasteful in this market. We could easily tear down and build a split home or 3 story apartments.. offering more homes to more people. 

I’m saying this not from a greed/investment standpoint, but from a pure inventory standpoint. More opportunities to become an owner, not just adding more rental units. We become prosperous if we all prosper.

The labour shortage, city permits/planning, material costs… it would make such project unobtainable.

But am I the only one that thinks we should convert the single homes into more dense multi dwelling units? 

Instead of the city/province helping big condo development projects, they should be helping individuals with these kind of projects.

The general idea is that I’d sell half my property, gain a profit (incentive for home owners), but allow a new homeowner to get into the market at a lower price point then what I purchased at. And allowing them to grow with the market as well over time.

Turn a 1M home into two 800k semi detached homes. 

And yeah, I know 800k is still crazy high.. but you can’t even find that right now even if you wanted to. That’s the issue. Not enough family sized homes. Just these condos, that are getting smaller and smaller.

It’s fine - colds and flus are normal, this one just has a really great PR campaign.   
We will be fine.   

Coronavirus seems to present 80% mild cases (and quite possible a fairly high percentage of cases so mild they go untested), but about 5% of people (mostly elderly) may need critical care.  

Right now we have the time and clarity to have a good plan in place, so let’s get our sticks together and provide a world-class response.  

The whole region could use a reminder about coughing into your elbow, washing hands when you get to school/work and also when you return home, and not touching your face unless you’ve just washed your hands first.  

Also a reminder that masks are for sick people to keep the sickness in and reduce spread. Masks won’t keep well people healthy unless they have a full-on hazmat suit.   

We should also have lost of hand sanitizer dispensers set-up across the city.  
It would be good to make sure everyone knows what to do if they think they could be sick (when to stay home vs when to go to hospital). The last thing you want to to is give your illness to everyone in the doctor’s office.  

Work places should start getting their work-from-home plans together, so that everyone knows how it will work if the staff get exposed to a sick person and have to work from home for two weeks just in case.   

The cruise season alone is going to bring-in ~283 ship calls will bring 770,000 passengers to the Greater Victoria region throughout the seven-month season (April 3 - Oct 21). 
https://gvha.ca/cruise/cruise-schedule/

With all the ships and people coming-and-going we may have to host a quarantine ship or two (Tow it over to CFB Esquimalt for care?).  

It would be good to properly set-up a coronavirus ward at one out two hospitals for the few really severe cases that could need respiratory support.  
One of the biggest problems with SARS in Ontario in 2003 was that at the start of the outbreak the hospital workers didn’t use proper PPE when dealing with patients, so lots of hospital staff got sick. We can avoid this.

VictoriaBC,corvus7corax,"More ships for us! Cruise line adds Victoria stops, exits Asia over coronavirus fears Andrew A. Duffy / Times Colonist
FEBRUARY 22, 2020 06:00 AM

Victoria’s cruise ship terminal at Ogden Point will be a little busier this spring as a result of cruise lines changing scheduled sailings to China and around Asia.
Fear of a spread of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, has pushed many cruise lines to change their schedules.
Celebrity Cruises will now have four extra stops in Victoria.
The Celebrity Millennium has added the calls at Victoria in April and May, said Greater Victoria Harbour Authority chief executive Ian Robertson. “They have been added as a result of ships leaving the Asia market and coming to the West Coast earlier than usual,” he said.
Industry insider website Cruisecritic.com said Celebrity has cancelled the rest of its 2020 season in Asia and instead will offer a series of three-, four- and five-night Pacific coast sailings.
The site said all passengers booked on Celebrity Millennium Asia cruises will receive a refund, plus a 25 per cent future cruise credit, and refunds of any excursions and onboard packages.
Robertson said the GVHA doesn’t expect to see any cancellations in Victoria as a result of the virus, but they are monitoring the situation closely and will be taking direction from the Cruise Lines International Association.
The CLIA’s member cruise lines have implemented precautions by cancelling sailings, rerouting others, restricting passenger and crew boarding, and boosting screening procedures for passengers boarding from Chinese ports or who have travelled in or through China, Hong Kong and Macau.
The cruise lines will be denying boarding to all persons who have travelled from, visited or transited via airports in China within 14 days before embarkation.
They will also deny boarding to those who, within 14 days before embarkation, have had close contact with, or helped care for, anyone suspected or diagnosed as having coronavirus, or who is currently subject to health monitoring for possible exposure to novel coronavirus.
Clipper Navigation has also added a minor screening tool, as a result of consultation with U.S. Customs.
According to the passenger ferry, which operates between Victoria and Seattle, customs will ask passengers if they have been to mainland China in the past 14 days.
If they answer yes and are not a U.S. citizen, they will be denied entry to the U.S.
If they answer yes and are U.S. citizens they will be permitted to enter the country, but the Center for Disease Control will be contacted. That organization may then have follow up questions or procedures.
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman told the Times Colonist the additional health screening was initially put in place at five U.S. airports — John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, San Francisco International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, Chicago-O’Hare International Airport and Atlanta International Airport, but that has since been expanded to eight additional locations including Seattle.
U.S. Customs officers have also been told to be alert for those who might have come from an infected region.
Canada Border Services Agency says it is working with the Public Health Agency of Canada to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 into Canada.
Geoff Dickson, chief executive of Victoria International Airport, said they are also monitoring the situation and so far there has been no direction from the Public Health Agency of Canada or Canada Border Services Agency to change any procedures.
“Our understanding is that enhanced messaging and screening measures have been implemented at the three Canadian airports with direct flights from China — Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver,” he said. https://www.timescolonist.com/business/cruise-line-adds-victoria-stops-exits-asia-over-coronavirus-fears-1.24081854",Point in Time,0,False,20.0

My cat, Curry, three-year-old male, pale buff with white chest, has been missing for four days. He is an indoor-outdoor cat but doesn't generally stay outdoors for too long so this is pretty unusual and we're getting pretty worried; we do know that he is not in the house. We've checked all of our neighbours' yards thoroughly and found nothing. We live near UVic, on the side of the dog park facing Cadboro-Gyro. 

[Some photos] (https://imgur.com/a/oWaqdhG)

Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone has been feeding or has recently seen a cat that matches that description. He doesn't have a collar as he's figured out how to remove them, but he does have a distinctive ID tattoo (numbers) inside his ear from the shelter.

VictoriaBC,cwt48,"Retirement/senior homes with Cantonese speaking staff? This is me thinking WAY down the road. My mom just turned 70 and while she's very capable of taking care of herself right now (she lives alone on the mainland), I'm preparing for the eventual reality that she won't be in about 10 years or maybe even less. She's open to the idea of going to a home here when the time comes. I'm wondering if there are any homes in town that have Cantonese speaking staff. She's conversational in English which is her second language, but I can tell that she's starting to struggle with it. She also started to say things like ""speaking English is so tiresome for me."" I'd like her to be as comfortable as possible when she's in a home. Of course, I understand things might be different 10 years from now, and yes I'll visit her as much as I can.

VictoriaBC,cycling_sysadmin,"Stolen Bike Hello ‪Reddit friends!

I had the unfortunate luck of having my bike stolen on Dec 1 at 3:30pm from 740 Hillside Ave. It was locked in a secure bike storage facility. 

The bike is a 2007 red Trek 1500 SLR with a Shimano ultegra groupset in grey and white Shimano RS31 wheels. The handlebars are also taped white. The building security cameras caught the robbery in progress. The video shows the fellow breaking in and going directly for my bike and ignoring the others. 

Please message me or contact the Victoria Police if you have any information about the bike or this man. (File # 15-54876)

VictoriaBC,czarl13,"Remembrance Day services (info gathered from a local website that we can't link to in reddit due to paywall issues)

Every year, Canadians pause to remember those who have served — and continue to serve — the country in war and peace. Members of Maritime Forces Pacific will take part in local ceremonies in more than 70 communities in British Columbia.

One way to continue to honour and remember their service and sacrifice is to meet and talk to them at Royal Canadian Legion branches, which will be open to the public after Remembrance Day ceremonies on Wednesday.

The branches, located in almost every community, are where one can find veterans of all wars as well as current serving sailors, soldiers, airmen and airwomen.

“Some are quiet, but some of the younger vets are opening up and talking,” said Angus Stanfield, past-president of the Royal Canadian Legion, B.C. and Yukon. “They find safety at the Legion.”

Every year they lose a few older members, so a recent decision to allow children in the facilities is seen as a positive move to breathe new life into the branches.

“Most people don’t realize that they don’t need to have a military background to be a member,” Stanfield said. “Anybody can now join.”

I've been looking for better jobs and I found a great job for a great international company that's 100% remote in Canada. I've somewhat, to an extent, always regretted never taking advantage of my Canadian citizenship and have wondered what the experience would be like to live there. I've also been feeling pretty homesick for somewhere more 'familiar' and not as 'foreign' to me, and am unsure if I see myself in Amsterdam long term, but I don't know. I also can't become a Dutch citizen without giving up my other citizenships and I am not willing to do that. My dad grew up in Canada and my sister went to college in Vancouver a few years ago, we have family there still so I'm familiar with some Canadian cities on a tourist basis but have heard all the negative things about COL, crime, quality of life etc. The salary for this role is only 70-75k CAD despite it seemingly being a better job on paper, right now I make 65 euros gross (4533 net per month with 30% ruling which I have for 5 years total) so this is my biggest concern and what makes me worry the move wouldn't be worth it. 

Thoughts on this move, would it be worth doing especially on this salary or am I just chasing something stupid? Things I value are walkability but living in a peaceful neighbourhood, a young social crowd where I can make friends, public transit, and nature access. I want to find somewhere I can stay and 'settle down' as I don't want to continue moving every couple years. I'm worried I'm hyping up the job opportunity and moving here in my head and that the reality will be far more bitter.

BEER WALK- Phillips/Canoe/The Drake/Spinnaker's as an afternoon project, since they keep you in downtown and with the nice views. No doubt that Hoyne/Driftwood/Moon are the best beer of the lot, but if I'm taking visitors out for the afternoon, I'd skip them.

poor mans poutine! Personally I'm a fan of the offerings of The Pink Bicycle and the Garrick's Head pub, both downtow

La belle patatte - cross the bridge - french canadian poutine shack

Beach Drive + Dallas Rd + Gonzales Hill Park are pretty beautiful. - scooter rental? 

Seafood: The blue crab in the coast hotel usually does a fine job

Intergalactic root beer - good shit, try it. 

Victoria has a wealth of fantastic breakfast places - Blue Fox, Jam, Shine, Pagliacci's (Only for Sunday Brunch 10am - 3pm), Floyd's Diner, 3rd Street Cafe (in Sidney)... My suggestion is to check out the menu for any of these places and see if they serve a smoked salmon eggs benedict. If they do, go to town!

Hernandez - mexican

Ferris' if you like Oysters.

Paggliaci's has great Italian food! It's on broad street (Empress side) pretty close to the empress.

Little Jumbo - great coctails, swanky

Bodega - Tapas Bar in trounce alley, outdoor space

Oak Bay is a nice area to walk up and down (the main strip), and walking/driving/jogging/ridding along Dallas Road (actually anywhere from the Sea Wall in Esquimalt all the way along the roads up to the start of Uplands is gorgeous - and you'll see some impressive houses that most of us dream of affording.

 There are plenty of amazing brew pubs that also do tours here. My favourites are Swans, Philips, Spinnakers, and Sea Cider (this is an apple cider brewery and OMG amazing!!). Sea Cider is actually really romantic and really love cost, however it is out in Saanichton (about 20 minutes out of town).

Definitely check out Garricks Head Pub, great small pub, good beer, good people, and good food. Pig is amazing, definitely check them out they make the best poutine ever. Zambri's is pretty awesome, great italian food its on the higher end of the scale but still worth it.

Standard tourist things: Butchard Gardens, Royal BC Museum, Beacon Hill Park.

Slightly less standard: dallas rd/Beach drive tour (get to see the water and some nice neighbourhoods). Mt Tolmie and Mt Doug viewpoints.

If you get the chance to check out restaurants: downtown: Il Terrazo, Pagliacci's. A bit of a drive and a bit of money: Deep Cove Chalet or Sooke Harbour House.

If you are heading out to butchart gardens, and you like french food... The Deep Cove Chalet is a must:

VictoriaBC,defund_vicpd_plz,"I work for homeless services on Pandora. Here's what's up. AMA. Hey, I'm a worker on the 900 block of Pandora. I provide outreach services to arguably our most vulnerable and disenfranchised street-based community. (Obviously won't be saying which organization I work for.) I see a lot of shit happen and even more shit spread about our community and want to share some perspectives with you and ask you to help make some positive changes.

There are a lot of problems that occur on or near the block. It is where the main building of Our Place is, and there is a safe drug injection site right next door and a newly opened safe inhalation site right across the street. SOLID and AVI do a lot of outreach services in the area. Combined, these organizations provide food, shelter, community care, places to warm up, places for people to do their substances safely while being supervised by trained employees, opportunities to be treated by a nurse or paramedic, opportunities to be referred to detox and treatment, and more. They are invaluable in maintaining the ongoing survival of those entrenched in addiction and homelessness in our district.

However, these organizations remain chronically underfunded. The safe injection site (one of only a handful on the island) had to decrease their hours a while back, which means more people are using and overdosing in the washrooms at Our Place. Our Place is facing staffing shortages right in the midst of freezing temperatures which means they have to close instead of being able to provide space for people to warm up. The city of Victoria delayed their emergency weather protocol and the options are limited and difficult to walk to if you are based downtown (see @backpackproject_victoriabc on Instagram for more info).

Organizations have been forced by inadequate funding to limit how much they give out many things, including matches, candles, bubble pipes (used to reduce the potential harms associated with meth consumption), hand warmers, coffee/tea, socks, scarfs, and gloves. Many workers at these organizations spend a good deal of their income making up for these funding deficits, which is abhorrent that the funding situation has made it necessary. The workers are not paid a lot (usually between 20-25 an hour, 33-40 hours a week) and often come from marginalized communities themselves. That's not to even speak of volunteers and activists who raise funds for things like sleeping bags and tents.

A huge problem that I see as a worker is that funding is consistently being increased for policing this area and its population while we get a fraction of this funding. Every day at 7am, we get to see 7-8 police and bylaw gather around individual tents and demand that people wake up and pack their shit, regardless of weather or temperature. We have a 7-7 camping bylaw that exists for no other reason than to appease wealthy business owners who care more about profits and property values than people. Us workers regularly see bylaw destroying and disposing of homeless people's tents and belongings when those homeless people leave for 5 minutes to visit one of our few publicly available washrooms. The homeless people who see bylaw taking all of their possessions say ""hey, I'm here, that's my stuff, thanks"", and bylaw says ""nope, you have 30 days to pick it up from this location :)"". This is the norm, not the exception. The whole time, police are also present to make sure the homeless don't get too upset about their entire lives being treated like garbage. 

Police also just waste time meeting quotas and attempting to justify their inflated budget. @vicpd_cause_harm on instagram recently posted about how a homeless person was ticketed and fined $230 for smoking a joint outside of Our Place. I messaged the account and they told me that person also has received SIX fines for camping, at $150 each. This person obviously has no way of paying these. It's ridiculous, it is needlessly criminalizing our most vulnerable population, and it's exactly the kind of thing that us workers see but are afraid to speak out about because of how ourselves and our organizations can be negatively affected by saying anything remotely negative about police. 

The proposed city budget for 2022 is seeing a 5% increase for police. A large amount of this is to continue policing our community when it doesn't need it. We don't need policing, we need more services. The man with half his clothes off, screaming at passersby is not helped by police. He is helped by interrupting the spiral into psychosis well beforehand by community mental health workers and assertive community treatment. The person breaking into a home for shit to sell (and the homeowner) is not helped by police. They are helped by low barrier supportive housing with enough funding to maintain staff, detox and treatment centre's that don't have months-long wait lists, and basic minimum income/high disability payouts. The woman dying of an opioid overdose on the corner is not helped by police (vicpd only reversed a couple dozen in the last year while we collectively reverse more than that in half a week). She is helped by numerous, well-funded safe consumption sites staffed by harm reduction and addiction workers who have referrals to detox and treatment (and which have been found to not increase crime in the surrounding area). 

People always wonder what the best way to help is. We see a lot of donations pass through from people who don't know that the brand new $200 tent they just donated will be tossed in a dumpster by bylaw in a few weeks. The best way you can help is to have yourself and your friends tell our city council (who controls funding) what YOU think is an appropriate use of your taxpayer dollars. Without your input, they will continue to quietly defund community services while increasing the absurd policing of the community we serve. It is our right and responsibility as private citizens to use our voices to assertively inform the city that it is no longer appropriate to ignore preventable deaths and other negative health outcomes for homeless people via these poor funding decisions.

Ask me anything, and I'm glad to help write that email with you. Here are the phone numbers and emails of the mayor and council - remember that your tax dollars pay for their salaries and it is totally fine for you to contact them. You should absolutely feel entitled to their time and they should be glad to hear from their constituents.

I had never thought to check how much different drug stores charged for prescriptions until I ended up on a rather inadequate insurance plan. The answer is that they vary a lot! And Pharmasave is expensive - about twice as much as London Drugs.

In the prescription on the left, notice that the London Drugs is for twice the amount, but is only $37 versus $33. In the one on the right, they are for precisely the same prescription. And only a day apart. But the Pharmasave price is more than twice that of London Drugs.

Looking through the subreddit posts, it seems like there is no shortage of people running into issues with Devon Properties.

Recently I have just finished dealing with an attempted illegal eviction from my current unit at The Star on Goldstream Ave, that will be another post at a later date detailing the tomfuckery they have tried to pull, and the blatant abuse of tenant rights that they think they can get away with (threatening to call cops, saying the lease has been terminated when it wasn't, much more).

Currently the building is undergoing an unannounced water shut off due to some issue that Devon has yet to announce. I have talked to a few neighbors today and at least one other tenant here mentioned that Devon recently tried to illegally evict them as well.

If anyone here is living at The Star on Goldstream, or if anyone knows anyone who is living there who has recently had Devon Properties attempt to illegally evict them, I would love to get in contact and hear what Devon has been up to, and to potentially discuss future options. You can DM me here on Reddit or reach out via email.

As a reminder to all, make sure you know your rights as a tenant here in BC and don't let anyone push you around when it comes to housing.

Thanks

* ""Two full-time workers earning Tokyo’s minimum wage can comfortably afford the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in six of the city’s 23 wards. ""
* ""In Tokyo, by contrast, there is little public or subsidized housing. Instead, the government has focused on making it easy for developers to build. A national zoning law, for example, sharply limits the ability of local governments to impede development.""
* ""Green space is scarce in Tokyo, living spaces are small by Western standards, and relentless redevelopment disrupts communities.""
* ""People treat homes like cars: They want the latest models. Between 2013 and 2018, new homes accounted for 86 percent of home sales in Japan""

Instead we have made an app for sending a photo to a trusted group of friends while shopping to get quick, anonymous feedback showing their opinion on your clothing choice.

Since we won StartupWeekend, it turns out the next step is something called ""Global Startup Battle,"" and we want to win! We will compete against teams from nearly 140 cities all around the world. If we can get in the top 15, our idea will get seen by some of the top names in the startup scene and help put Victoria startups on the map.

Victoria, BC – Patrol officers are reminding residents of Victoria and Esquimalt of the vital importance of “social and physical distancing” as a public health precaution after being called to a noise complaint about a house party last night.

Esquimalt Division Patrol officers were called to a report of a loud gathering at a suite in a home in the 800-block of Phoenix Street in Esquimalt just after 10 p.m. last night. When officers arrived, they discovered a group of people having a house party. Officers instructed the participants to go home due to the noise complaint and explained the dangers of such a gathering during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Hello there,

I am a tenant and live with a roommate in 2 bedroom basement of a house.

We are in month-month basis agreement.

My situation is that I want to move out by May 1st and today I let the landlord know about it.

Landlord told me that notice to end tenancy means for all of the tenants in the rental unit and demanded that the they receive all of our notices from me and from my roommate. However, my roommate wishes to continue stay after I move out.

I know what Multiple tenants rule is and I guess the landlord is correct but what if my roommate wishes to continue to stay and I want to move out and landlord demanding we both give them notice to end tenancy?

This doesn't make sense at all to me and I am in need of help of advice for my situation really badly.

I just wanted to put this out here so that I can hear out what others think about our situation at our workplace. Currently, I am really perplexed about our situation.

I work at a daycare in Victoria.

Very recently, around 8 of our coworkers got positive results on Covid-19 testing. Not on the same day but day after day. 

It didn't take long until all of us had to book for rapid testing kit as more and more weren't showing up due to positive test results and all of us were getting worried. (rn, all of us have to wait a few or more days to get the kit)

I've wrote a letter to the employer about our opinions that we'd like to see the place temporarily close for the safety of the children and everyone else around.

Only answers we are getting is that they encourage to show up to work saying that BCCDC has no restrictions set for daycare.

More importantly, according to BC policy, unvaccinated close contacts must self-quarantine, but parents are not informed as more and more staff got positive results.

**When 3 staffs got Covid, they informed the parents but after we had 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th staffs getting positive results, they are not informing the parents anymore and I just think this is pure bullshit.**

I have witnessed 2 incidents in a relatively short period of time and wanted to hear some other thoughts:

(1)  I was walking southbound along the Galloping Goose Trail by the Victoria Harbour Ferry Railyards stop when I saw a gentleman, also walking southbound, hugging the west side of the path. I didn't think much of it until a cyclist came up and slowed right down and kept telling the man that it was a bike lane over and over again. The walking gentleman had earphones in so didn't seem to hear him but continued a few feet then turned in towards the Regatta Landing Public Washrooms.

(2) I was biking along the Galloping Goose southeast bound that follows HWY 1. I got close to the Trail switch by uptown where I could continue east along the Lochside Regional Trail or south continuing on the Galloping Goose. I signalled that I was going right and then started to turn. I then hear as I'm mid-turn yell ""thanks for not signalling a$$h0le"".

In both cases a few seconds of just waiting or just taking a deep breath would not leave such a sour taste in my mouth. Is it annoying when a group of 2-3 people walk side by side on parts of the Galloping Goose? Sure but it seems that there was a level of discomfort than only confrontation was the option of resolving.

Funnily enough after I saw the cyclist in (1) I was returning from my trip the opposite way and saw him with 2 other ladies COMPLETELY taking up the bike lane by Fol Epi. I didn't feel the need to say anything but it gave me a chuckle to think of the hypocrisy.

VictoriaBC,felixbc,"So, where do you put your bike when crossing to the bike path from Mackenzie at Borden? (2 part left turn) 
Coming from Mackenzie, turning left onto the Lochside trail intersection at Borden is awkward. I do it in 2 parts, as a left hand turn in traffic from the far right bike lane on Mackenzie is just dangerous. Where would you position your bike on the corner? 

I usually stop ahead of the bike lane stop line, just about exactly where the bike is in the Google maps image. I would prefer to join the end of any line up at the intersection, but with the bike lane separators I’d have to turn right into the bike lane, stop a few feet in, get off, and turn my heavy bike 180° to face the correct direction. Stopping farther forward is just more sensible. 

I ask because I did this awkward 2 part turn this evening, and seem to have pissed off the lone cyclist at the intersection. When the light finally changed he zipped around me. There was lots of room, I thought little of it. 

But about 400m onwards, just past the recycling place and the stoneware place where there’s nothing next to the trail, he stopped, waited for me, and then rode alongside me. “You shouldn’t ride like that. I’m telling you. I don’t know if this is your first time in a bike but you can’t ride like that.” I didn’t answer, so he repeated himself a bit more, but didn’t say what I’d done to piss him off. 

I know cyclists aren’t fond of what are they called, salmoners? People who ride to the front of the pack at a stop light. But how, and why, would I ride backwards on the bike path, turn 180° just to line up behind one dude? 

And how is my faux pas worse than waiting for a female cyclist on an isolated bit of the trail and berating her? Dude, you’re creepy. 

At any rate, if anyone can tell me how to make a safer left turn at Borden, I’d love to hear it.","front line, front line worker",0,False,38.46153846153847
VictoriaBC,felixthefabled,"Are there any renters here with ESAs (Emotional Support Animals)? **I want to preface by saying: please don’t leave rude/unnecessary comments. I’ve been a tenant my whole adult life thus far and know how generally challenging it is to find pet friendly housing**

I’m looking for advice from any fellow tenants or other knowledgeable people about Emotional Support Animals regarding questions such as if it’s possible to get an ESA certificate before actually getting the pet, and if you have experience looking for housing with an ESA.

A few things on my mind,

- Is it possible to get an ESA certificate before owning a pet? I don’t want to get into legal issues if landlord finds out I got the pet before the certificate is issued.

- I’m currently renting a basement suite from a private landlord. Would there be real legal issues/possibility of being kicked out if I managed to get an official ESA certificate before pet adoption? (A few sites I’m looking at claim it’s supposed to protect you from no pet clauses)

- How would you go about searching for future rentals? I’m aware the market is crazy and landlords have the ability to pick out of a huge list. Do you not mention the pet and then present the certificate after lease is signed?

My intention is not to be shady or jump through loopholes, but I feel it’s what many people in BC are resorting to.

I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression with motivation and energy still being a struggle even on meds. I also feel alone quite often as I’m currently no-contact with my family.

I’ve grown up with cats/dogs all my life and have never owned my own pet due to landlord restrictions despite believing it would help my mental health immensely.

Thank you for any advice.

• I live on the top floor of a newer apartment building, but it at least doesn’t have great cooling insulation (my apartment gets hot during the day without AC).

• I prefer to be more cold than hot. Lately when I get home I immediately turn my AC on full blast at 72 or 71F and have often left it running all night on hotter days.

VictoriaBC,fibreofmybean,"SCAMMER WARNING SIDNEY/VICTORIA Hello everyone, I am writing this post to warn Sidney citizens about a scam that happened to my Aunt and Uncle.

This is the story:

A man came to my aunt and uncle's house earlier this week. He obviously knew some information about our family because he knew names and personal details. The man claimed that my uncle's son had been in a car with a friend who was drunk and hit someone. He claimed that my uncle's son was in hospital and injured, as well as facing legal punishment. It was so elaborate that a ""lawyer"" who happened to be at the hospital at the time spoke with them all on the phone. This scam was very detailed and thoroughly planned out. They even had someone acting as my uncles son on the phone, speaking slurred because of his ""injuries"". 

Unfortunately for my family the scammer managed to walk away with an alarming amount of cash from the family safe. 

I'm writing this to WARN others. My uncle and aunt are elderly and were clearly targeted. They also don't have any security cameras, which I'm sure contributed to this attack. This is a very well planned scam and they are counting on people to panic and make quick decisions.

Please protect yourselves and your loved ones ❤ even if you can't afford security cameras, putting up a fake camera or a broken one might detour these low-life scammers. Also, if someone turns up at your door, immediately follow up with your family and even consider calling the police. 

Please stay safe everyone 💖

Edit: I know this is an age old scam. What's different is that this was done in person. Much easier in covid times because you can wear a mask, which is exactly what this guy did. 

ANYWAY all this post is is a reminder to call your loved ones and just remind them about these scams. That simple reminder could be what saves them!","Affordable Housing, Affordable housing ",0,False,0.0

I work in an elementary school. What gives? And what should I do? The BC Gov't website says that boosters are recommended at 6 months and that I'll be contacted. That should have been three months ago. Now, I call hoping to get a booster in time for the school year to start as I want to do my absolute best to keep the kids and their families safe. The person on the phone had to tell me that I was essentially choosing this meh booster or a presumed-to-be more effective omicron booster, but with no estimate of when that one's coming ('sometime in the fall'). This means it could be up to a YEAR after my last booster before I get the Omicron spec. one, if I choose to wait while knowing I'm hardly protected at all.

I don't feel good about this decision either way. I feel like I should have been boosted in late spring as per their instructions, which would have made me eligible for the fall Omicron jab. But because I followed their instructions, I'll be working in a school with minimal protection for myself and the children that the gov't should be protecting.

Since the former Vancouver Island sub has been kamakazed by its current mod duo, I am hoping to get another thriving Vancouver Island Reddit community up and running! I do realize a couple other subs are currently doing the same thing, and I think that's great and believe we share the same goal. If you haven't heard about the recent goings-on over at [r/VancouverIsland](https://www.reddit.com/r/VancouverIsland/), see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/156umw8/rvancouverisland_mods_putting_me_in_my_place_%E3%83%84/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for some context.

The reason I have decided to create [r/VancouverIsleBC](https://www.reddit.com/r/VancouverIsleBC/) is, honestly, because I prefer the name to the others and think it will help increase membership in the long-term (especially for those who are searching for the sub formerly known as [r/VancouverIsland](https://www.reddit.com/r/VancouverIsland/)). Further, because the other new subs currently have membership in max the low hundreds, I think we're still in the trial period to see which sub gains traction and can possibly take the place of [r/VancouverIsland](https://www.reddit.com/r/VancouverIsland/) (RIP). My honest hope is that we can get ONE of these subs to grow quickly and become a useful hub. Of course I hope this sub, r/VancouverIsleBC, is ultimately the one to do that. But if we don't gain traction, I'll do my best to promote and contribute to whichever sub is doing the best to fill the current void.

If anyone would like to apply to help moderate this sub, shoot me a message and tell me a bit about yourself! Let's get this thing going! Other than being a Vancouver Island resident, the only real must-haves is a willingness to engage positively with the community and have enough time to pop by here somewhat regularly.

I see this sub as a community fostered by Vancouver Island, and for Vancouver Island. Here, we listen to the community, make pragmatic changes and updates, engage with all users in good faith, and do our best to maximize the experience for those who wish to post, comment, and browse here.

Any feedback is welcome, and please don't hesitate to message, post, comment, etc. about what you'd like to see there! The sub is only a few hours old, so please let me know what needs to be created, built, edited, etc. next in order to create the best user experience.

The only service he needed was an oil change but they ""diagnostically"" said the car needed a new spark plug, wheel rotation and the works.

The whole maintenance/service took around $1,300. The bad part was, we are not sure if they really did anything.  


Some of our suspicion:   
\*We requested a diagnostic report of the car but they can't provide any   
\*There was a tire rotation but checking back the car, you can see the tire tread on the front are a lot less than the back \(The car is FWD\)   
\*My uncle left the Dash Cam running and saw the car got in and out of the garage multiple times but no sign of some parts being open. \(Not very conclusive since you can only watch the front\)   
\*When we check the panel to be open to get into the spark plugs, we saw some adhesive glue on the screws. \(We are not sure if they re\-glue it but it is still suspicious\)

please see attached picture of a post by one of those landlords (captured from House Hunt Victoria blog).

Added:  Moving is stressful. The one month rent is a compensation for the tenants’ stress **otherwise wouldn’t happen if not for landlord moving in**. So a decent landlord should give the formal notice as soon as they know (be it 4 months or 2) plus the compensation, even if the tenants are not aware of the rule.

([https://www.cheknews.ca/resident-at-sunset-lodge-dies-from-covid-two-more-staff-members-test-positive-876032/](https://www.cheknews.ca/resident-at-sunset-lodge-dies-from-covid-two-more-staff-members-test-positive-876032/))

Added: the infected number in Sunset Lodge care home increased to 34 as of Sept 1st.

**Why there is a big outbreak at a facility that has over 97% vaccination rate?**

Per CBC news today:

""The government … decided we shouldn't impose restrictions; we will rely on vaccines for protection. But then we realized that it is very difficult to stop the infections with the delta variant,"" said Cyrille Cohen, head of the lab of immunotherapy at Bar-Ilan University and a member of the Israeli Health Ministry's advisory committee for clinical trials on COVID-19 vaccines.

""What we should have done is to keep some restrictions — for example, wearing of the mask inside,"" he said.

And his message to Canadians who were vaccinated more than six months ago: ""You are vulnerable. You are more vulnerable than what you were three months ago, especially when facing the delta variant.""

Maybe that most of us, if not all, will get Covid sooner or later, if not already. We just have to learn how to live with it, e.g. use **masking and physical distancing** to delay and spread out the infection wave, and keep **vaccination going periodically** to reduce hospitalization and death.

**Please don't close #YYJ vaccination clinics**!

VictoriaBC,fribby,"Need some advice about a residential lease expiring Hey Victoria! I've also posted this to [r/britishcolumbia](http://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/). It's time sensitive though so I thought I'd try my luck here as well. 

I really need some advice about what to do in this situation. I have a year long lease which expires July 31st.


Three days ago I received an email from our property management company which states ""Please let us know whether you will be staying on with us by no later than May 28, 2015. After this date we will need to start advertising the unit.""


Do I really have to let them know this early if I plan to stay for another year? It's impossible to find a place that is available August 1st right now, so I am feeling pressured and trapped, which isn't helped by the fact that they effectively gave me a week to make other plans if I don't want to sign on for another year.


I found this info on the government site:
""If a fixed-term tenancy agreement (or a lease) has a move-out clause that requires the tenant to move out at the end of the term, the tenant can move at the end of the term without giving the landlord notice. When a fixed-term agreement doesn’t require the tenant to move out at the end of the term, the tenant must serve written notice to end the tenancy so that it’s received:


-At least one month before the effective date of the notice, and


-Before the day that rent is due""


So it would seem that I don't actually have to give notice until the end of June, is that correct? Can they start showing my home even though I may end up staying?


I've lived here several years but the rent is going to go up so I'd like to explore my options, but given the fact that I apparently only have four more days to do so things aren't looking great.

*""British Columbia continues to be the most expensive place to be a renter in the country, according to new data released by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.*

*The Metro Vancouver area once again topped the list of the average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment in a purpose-built development at $2,002.*

*The next closest metro area is more than $200 lower, with Toronto at $1,779.* 

*The third and fourth most expensive metro areas were also in B.C., with Victoria at $1,669 and Kelowna at $1,690.*  

*Overall, the average price of a two-bedroom apartment across all B.C. communities with at least 10,000 people was $1,721, up 11 per cent from 2021 and the highest figure in Canada.* 

*Meanwhile, the vacancy rate in British Columbia was 1.3 per cent, down from 1.4 per cent last year and the lowest in the country outside Atlantic Canada.* 

*Eric Bond, a senior specialist with the CMHC, said the increased prices are tied to tight rental markets and inadequate supply.*

*""When demand for rental is exceeding supply, it creates conditions when rents can increase particularly upon turnover,"" he said.*

*""It's an interesting dynamic that is taking place there, but all of this comes back to having a shortage of rental in B.C.""*

*The annual CMHC report is the only systematic national analysis done annually. For 2022 it included data looking at the increase in rents after someone had moved out of a unit.*

*In those situations, the average two-bedroom unit in British Columbia increased in rent from $1,742 to $1,927 — a 27 per cent increase.* 

*Bond said that one bright spot in B.C. was that 3800 new purpose-built rental units had been completed in the Metro Vancouver region, the highest number since they started compiling the figures in 1991.* 

*But he said more needed to be done.* 

*""That's a very welcome development, but the vacancy rate still decreased … that means we continue to need more rental supply.""*",BC Housing,1,True,25.0

I was up in Shawnigan today and drove down Sooke Lake Rd knowing damn well I'd hit a gate, and sure enough I did, with text reading 'Sooke Entrance Gate' which had me pumped because it was so cool to see such a sign way up the malahat.  You see a similar result by driving up Sooke Lake Rd down in Goldstream not long after turning onto it.

So what I've heard is that a car(s) crashed into it or something along those lines?  Thus they deemed it unsafe to expose the watershed like that.  When did they gate off Sooke Lake Rd?  My dad remembers driving it and recalls how beautiful the route was (so sad we can't experience it!).

Also, when I was in Shawnigan visiting a friend, he claimed that since there are tons of trails around where he lives (west Shawnigan), it's possible to ride (dirt bike) to Sooke/Goldstream from where he is.  Has anyone ever ridden a route like this?  Is it possible on a mountain bicycle?  He said it would pass Sooke Lake (he's never done if, only heard about it), but wouldn't that mean there is a huge chance of getting caught and fined?  I mean, if you were to go on a weekend theoretically it would be less risky.

All I'm trying to say is I would love to go see Sooke Lake with my own eyes and if there is a way to bike there safely, be it from the parking lot with mailboxes by the four-lanes toward Sooke, up by harbourview rd in Sooke, or starting in Shawnigan, which at the gate on Sooke Lake Rd up there is only **2** kilometers away.

(Apologies to mods if this breaks any rules)

I realize in the end this will likely require legal advice but I am wondering if anyone has gone through the same situation recently.

My Wife and I put a 10% down payment for a future build of a 750K home on May 24 2021 with a completion date of March 28 2022.

On January 20 2022, we had to sign an amendment of the possession date to ""on or before September 30, 2022""

On August 05 2022, we had to sign another amendment of the possession date to January 7, 2023.

On December 7 2022, when the Mortage paperwork was getting finalized they had us sign another amendment to the possession date to January 20 2022.

January 5 2023, we were told they cannot make the January 20 timeline in terms of having enough completed to secure the occupancy permit.

The mortgage rates have gone up substantially since the first possession date was missed.

Currently, the financer of the build tells us he is going to reach out to our bank and try to work on extending the previous mortgage rate until the new completion date of February 2023.

This latest delay is probably going to increase my 5-year fixed (30-year amortization) from 5.49 to 5.89.

I will require another house inspection at the cost of $500, the builder would not confirm this will be covered.

The builder told us that giving us our deposit back could be possible but they would need our home and secure a new deposit which would then be passed on to us. Not a convenient option but still an option.

I have not given notice at my current rental, no hardship with housing other than the inconvenience and extra cost of short notice moving.

My spouse tried to enjoy the beach with our two very small children today and ended up coming home in tears after multiple large dogs kept harassing them while the owners just stood there and laughed. She was literally holding both our crying kids and trying to get these dogs to go away and all the owners did was say ""it's a nice dog."" No attempt to get the dogs to leave them alone, nothing. Most people are courteous about calling their dogs back or leashing them briefly, but this kind of thing happens more often than I would like. We've had dogs run right through picnics, etc. 

I get that you think your dog is nice. It probably is. However, I don't know that for sure and I am sure not going to risk my kids' safety on your assertion that it is nice. There are lots of reasons why someone may not want an unknown animal approaching them such as phobias, allergies, past traumatic experiences, etc. Please have the courtesy to keep your dogs to yourself/themselves unless someone shows interest in approaching them and interacting with them. Think of it like flirting: if someone seems uncomfortable, they probably aren't interested. 

Thank you for reading, and all the best to you and your furry beach friends.

Right off the bat i want to say i am a man, but my girlfriend has to go through hell every time she goes to the doctor's office.  Because of covid i can't even go in to help advocate for her. 

 Basically she always feels sick but we don't know what is wrong.  The past month plus she has been dizzy, fatigued, bad stomach problems which swing from diarrhea to constipation no matter what kind of diet she is on.  Really these kinds of issues have come up every few months over the past decade.  And the process is always the same.  She sees a doctor who tries to rush her out as fast as he can.  When she brings up multiple issues/symptoms they get visibly agitated.  God forbid she suggest a test she might need after spending hours on the internet trying to find answers.  

She also has pretty bad anxiety to begin with so her eyes start to tear up and he snaps at her with ""ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO ME?  YOUR EYES ARE WANDERING THE ROOM!"" as she tries to stave off a panic-attack.   Gives her a scrip for some blood tests (blood tests she's had done every few years and they just shrug their shoulders and say ""you might be a little anemic try getting more iron."" ) And shoo her away.  No instructions of where to go or what to do once the tests have been done.  

Absolutely zero concern for her mental wellbeing and just a general pompous attitude that makes you feel like you are inconveniencing him to ask him to do his fucking job.  It's not just one clinic, its not just one doctor, it's not even just male doctors. It's a fucking epidemic and something needs to be done about either their education, addressing their burnout?  addressing their total emotional apathy?  Are these doctors only working in clinics because they are too shitty to get jobs anywhere else?  What is the answer here?

VictoriaBC,hamildub,"""concerned families of saanich"" Has anyone else received an email from this group? I'm wondering if anyone has more context to this.

Tldr: braefoot community association was kicked out of the building they've operated out of for decades without reason.

Body of email:

October 13, 2022
 

Dear Families of Saanich,

With the municipal election just around the corner, many families in Saanich feel a change is needed. Saanich Council has lost a lot of transparency in the last few years, and we are concerned about many of the decisions that they have made. There are many examples but one we feel really illustrates the lack of community support is the current situation with the building at Braefoot Park which remains empty and not usable for the community since the Mayor and Council took it over.

The building in Braefoot Park was built through the hard work and dedication of a not-for-profit called the Braefoot Community Association. They funded the construction, sourced the materials, and found volunteers to get the building completed. The building was then donated to Saanich, because it was in the park, and it was agreed that the Association would be able to run programming there in perpetuity. They would be in charge of all interior use and maintenance, and Saanich would look after the exterior, and have some access to the building in partnership with the Association.

For over 35 years, that agreement held strong. The Association hosted a wide array of groups in the building, and in addition to the space they provided, they offered other services to help, including fundraising, volunteers, and advertising. Multi-use space in Saanich is very hard to find, and the Association worked hard to ensure the community had full access. The space in the Braefoot building was used for community fundraisers, weddings, child care, programs for adults with additional needs, athletic programs, community meetings, community get togethers and more.

Even now, the Association continues to run affordable child care programs and give away bursaries, in spite of the devastating loss of the building. Despite having the most affordable programs in Saanich, the mayor and council took aim to replace Braefoot’s programs with Saanich Recreation programs. This is not the type of collaboration it takes to have healthy support for family based programs. Saanich needs a mayor and council that can work collaboratively with the community to make partnerships like this work to the benefit of all the residents in the community.

In December of 2020, in the midst of a global pandemic, Saanich announced that they would not be renewing the Braefoot Community Association’s lease on the building. Over the next month, more than 1,000 letters went to the City Councillors of Saanich from concerned members of the community asking that they reconsider. The Association never received a response. Despite the Association reaching out multiple times, our Saanich Council directed them to Parks Staff, and the staff directed them back to Council; no one would tell them why. When Braefoot reached out to councillors, many of them ignored Braefoot and when asked why they said it was at the direction of the Mayor. Recently on her Facebook Profile, Natalie Chambers responded to a question about the situation with this:

“I did ask for and I trusted the information I got and I did not think I needed to research that information. My good friend and Saanich resident informed me during the deliberations. The loss of community attributes. I was given incomplete information and none of the historical information. At that time I was new and still trusting. I am so sorry that I did not do the right thing. Or had better information to protect the community.

This lack of information leading to this decision made me the councillor that I am today. It was embarrassing and humiliating for me to miss this. I felt duped.”

 - Natalie Chambers, Saanich Councillor

In September of 2021, the lease was up, and the Association was forced to move their office, their storage, and all of their programs off site. Since then, the building has remained empty at a new cost to taxpayers of tens of thousands of dollars per year. The community is unaware of any plan or announcement about reopening the building, Saanich appears to have no plans and recently the Saanich Mayor said it was due to Covid that they could not open the building, Braefoot has been willing and open to operating it since the issue arrose in 2020.

Losing the building was a huge loss to the Braefoot area, not just for the Association, but for the community. The building was being funded by sponsorships and grants, which allowed for affordable programs for families. Braefoot was never told they were doing anything in contravention to the municipality's mandate and was never given an opportunity to rectify any shortcomings that the Mayor and council may have identified. The question families keep going back to is why? Why would our Saanich Council take a building away from our community based not-for-profit organization? Why would the mayor and council just leave it empty and unusable? Saanich Council has left the Community guessing as there is no transparency to allow for the facts to be established.

Most recently, the Association has been trying to get two new child care spaces up and running to replace the old building and the red tape and slow process from the municipality of Saanich has caused one location to be stalled for over a year and a second location has been stalled for over 6 months. This stalling and slow process has caused many families to go without child care for months and created financial strain in the community association. When Braefoot reached out for help with the process they were ignored by the current mayor and council.

Not-for-profits like the Braefoot Community Association provide an invaluable service, particularly to those who cannot otherwise afford the services they offer. They are important pillars of our community and Saanich Council should be collaborating with them. Saanich families don’t want another term of Saanich City Councillors who do not collaborate with the community. 

The community is supportive and look forward to transparency and support for families in our community.  We would like to see a new family and community based approach to take hold leading to collaboration with the community and admin staff at Saanch. This would be a welcomed change to what we have seen over the current term.

This is only one example of the lack of community and taxpayer support from the Saanich mayor and council. Let’s work together to change Saanich for the better. Please consider voting in a new mayor and council that shows support through their actions.

Sincerely,

Concerned Families of Saanich","Community Plan to End Homelessness , Peer Housing Support Program, Service provider ",0,True,40.0

VictoriaBC,harit66,"What are the Healthcare Expenses in Victoria? Hello there,

This  is one of my follow up posts with questions specifically on Healthcare. I visited Victoria recently and totally loved the place (I come from Montreal).

I talked around and locals told me that they pay $35 for the healthcare and another one for the PharmaCare. I thought Canada has public healthcare and is paid by the taxes government collect from the individuals. However, that does not seem aligned with my understanding.

Also, when I looked around on PharmaCare, I realized that the deductible is based on the percentage of the the income. And after the deductible limit is hit, the bill is split by 70%, 30% between government and the person. 30% could be very large depending upon someone's situation.

Here are mine!

To be clear I am not anti-bike, I do believe that cyclists form an important part of transportation but the needs of cyclists need to be well balanced with public transportation, pedestrians and vehicles. In my opinion Victoria could be doing a lot better here. I also find these stats really hilarious. 

**Whoa 530,000 trips that is like a really big number! Success!**

Lets break down the trips stat:
530,000 trips over a 14 month operation
That is ~420 days with 1,262 trips per day, assuming 1 person is likely accounting for 2 trips a day (to wherever they are going and back) that is about 650 people per day commuting by bike. To me that number doesn't really seem that large when you look at it like that. In addition, how many of those riders would have alternatively walked or taken the bus to their destination if the lanes didn't exist? 

And as for the decrease in greenhouse gas emissions I would love to see how that works with the increase of cars now idling at fort intersections and pandora for say 30-60 seconds. Trying to drive out of downtown is now extremely painful with the new lanes, especially when you are waiting with no cyclists!

Things she yells includes ""control your animal"" ""my dog is on a leash"", and ""leash your dog"" well after the dog approaches hers. She seems bad at communication is general as she doesn't stop yelling and walks away very quickly.

I can understand if her dog was attacked previously that she's protective, maybe she's new to the area and isn't aware (or able to hear out of her own fear/belligerence), but kicking a dog that's clearly exhibiting no signs of aggression is really needed up man.

I pulled into a parking spot and waited. Once it left I went but I saw another car come the same way I did so it doesn't seem like one way. But there's only one lane so two cars won't fit. 

Anyone enlighten me? Thanks!","front line, front line worker",0,False,0.0

VictoriaBC,hobojoe3rd,"Trying to re-discover the spark of the Island Hey everyone, it's been a tough few years for all of us. I've been house hunting for 18 months and slowly watching my dreams disappear as I get outbid by 100k on townhouses in Langford. Wages stalled at work even as we post record profits. Anyways, we've heard the same story over and over, that's not why I'm here. 

I'm here to ask for your help as I re-discover the spark of living on Vancouver Island. I need to remember why it's worth it to live here. I'm born and raised in Victoria and my lifelong friends are here. That part of it makes sense to me.

I'm here today to ask you all: why do you live here? What about Vancouver Island makes you excited, motivated, and willing to make sacrifices?

VictoriaBC,holdencaulfield1983,"Downstairs Suite Noise Level Hi r/VictoriaBC. A couple months ago I made a post asking about ways to soundproof a downstairs suite in a house we just bought. Got some great advise, most of which involved very expensive solutions unfortunately. Decided to try a couple small solutions to see if they would help. So far tried sealing up the vents leading to the downstairs suite and adding blow-in insulation in the downstairs ceiling. Unfortunately these have done nothing to stop sound transmission and additional solutions are not in the budget right now. We haven't rented out the suite yet but starting to feel discouraged and wondering if we should even be trying to rent out the suite at all...

My question is to anyone who has lived in a downstairs suite and/or has rented out a downstairs suite. What level of soundproofing do you expect when you're in that living situation? How much do you expect to hear from the folks above/below you? I've never lived in/rented out a downstairs suite before and wanted to get a sense of other people's expectations.

TLDR; How much sound do you expect to hear from upstairs when living in a downstairs suite?

Edit: Thanks to all who replied! A few said it's better to spend the money and get proper sound proofing but most are suggesting to be just be upfront with potential renters about the noise level and manage expectations from the start. Once the suite is cleaned up we'll give it a try and maybe hope to find someone half deaf haha!",BC Housing,1,False,0.0

Attention Residents

NOTICE TO VACATE


Regarding 2770 Claude Road, Langford, British Columbia

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR LEASE WITH CENTURION PROPERTY ASSOCIATES INC.

PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY

Dear Resident of RidgeView Place,

 

By way of this bulletin, we are providing you with the difficult but important notice to vacate your unit immediately.

 

We recognize that there is never a convenient time to receive this notice, and for those of you who have been long-time tenants, this may be particularly frustrating. We share your frustrations and apologize for the significant inconvenience this causes, however, our first priority is your safety. We ask Residents to only pack essential items at this time. We’re working diligently to gather additional information and will provide an update by the end of the week.  

 

We recently received notice from the Engineers and Geoscientists of BC (“EGBC”) about serious concerns with certain structural elements of the building. While the EGBC did not recommend evacuations, we immediately retained an independent engineer to visit the site, who identified serious safety concerns and recommended that tenants evacuate.

 

In light of this development, your current contract with Centurion Properties Associates Inc. has been frustrated as of April 24, 2023. This means that under the laws of the Residential Tenancy Act [SBC 2002] Ch. 78 and Frustrated Contract Act [RSBC 1996] Ch. 166, both parties to the contract are relieved from fulfilling their obligations under the contract. Therefore, your tenancy has ceased, along with your rental obligations, and you must vacate your unit.


Additionally, here are some actions we recommend you take immediately:

Contact your tenant insurance provider as parts of your expenses for temporary accommodation and other expenses may be covered by your policy.

Email ridgeview@centurion.ca to provide written notice once you have vacated your unit.


Here are additional supports Centurion is offering:

Centurion will provide each unit with $1,000.00 payable to the leaseholder via cheque or e-transfer as a gesture of compassionate assistance.

All Residents will be reimbursed for your rent between the dates of April 24-30, 2023, and any prepaid rents. All damage and pet deposits will be returned. Arrangements to pick up these funds can be made by contacting the Resident Manager. 

Centurion has multiple buildings in the Langford and Victoria Area and can help assist in relocating you to one of our other buildings with similar accommodation, subject to availability. Centurion’s Customer Care Center is available 7 days a week at 1-844-830-5736. You can also visit our website at www.cpliving.com for the most current availability.

﻿Moving trucks are available Monday, April 24 until 8pm, and Tuesday April 25 9am - 5pm PDT for light items.

Assistance for Residents with special requirements and pets can contact Resident Manager

 

Please be advised that all Residents will be welcome to return to their original unit once the remediation is complete. If this is something you are considering, please let the site staff know and we can contact you directly.

 

At this time, it is still too early to provide a firm update on when work will be completed. We are still collecting information from the engineers for review and there are no firm timelines available. The option of temporary shoring of the garage area is currently being reviewed with the engineers to provide residents safe access to come back and retrieve their belongings. Future communication in this regard will be sent out accordingly.

 


LIABILITY FOR LOSS/DAMAGE or INJURY


We do not accept any liability for loss or damage to any of your belongings or property. This letter serves as official notice for you to vacate the unit immediately. All our contractual obligations have ended as of the date of frustration, namely April 24, 2023.

 

Anyone who chooses to ignore this notice and does not vacate, does so at their own risk and will be deemed to freely accept and fully assume all such risks, dangers and hazards and possibility of personal injury, death, property damage, expense and related loss, including loss of income or property.

 

Thank you for your understanding during what we know is a difficult time for you and your household. We commit to providing you with updates as they become available and keeping you informed.

My intention in making this post was informational only, not to comment on service Canada workers, covid, or why a person would be in a rush to get passport services. Thanks all! 


Hello all, I just wanted to give some information as of May 3rd 2022 about the passport centre in the Bay Centre.

You don't need an appointment, but you do need to arrive VERY early (I was there at 4:30 and was first in line, but people started showing up very shortly after!) And most importantly: your date of travel (WITH PROOF) needs to be *within 5 business days* or they will turn you away and tell you to come back. 

By 8:30, the time they open, there were about 150 people in line. 

If you arrive at the centre before the doors are open, wait at the View Street entrance and around 6am the security guard will let you upstairs to wait outside the office.

Just wanted to give that information since folks are travelling more and I had trouble finding info on where to go/what to expect.

Edit: y'all, people sometimes don't have much notice when travelling, of course the ideal is to not do it in a rush. Some of the folks I talked to in line sent in their passport applications at the beginning of March and haven't heard anything and are leaving in 2 days. I figured there were a lot of different reasons people need walk in passport services, that's why I made this post of what to expect if you don't have the option to make an appointment.",front line worker,0,False,7.6923076923076925

Hi all,

Just wondering if there is any home shop hobbyists in the area looking for like minded friends?

Anyone interested in chatting over a coffee about projects?

Maybe even work on a few together? (just help one another, no expectations)

I have a small shop with the standard wood working tools (Table saw, drill press, band saw ect...)

I also have a metal lathe and milling machine. I built a 3d printer and a benchtop CNC machine many years ago.

\- My current major project is building another CNC machine to replace the old one (Yea know, Bigger, Better, Badder! lol)

I'm in Colwood area.

\- This is not a business prop, I am not for higher and not looking to higher.

\- I'm just looking for a few like minded builder friends.

So, whatcha currently making?!

**Where: Tim Horton's at 845 Goldstream Ave, Langford.**

**When: Saturday, June 4th, at 2pm.**

I would like to open this up for anyone interested in finding like minded shop friends.

A simple social gathering to get together to discuss hobby shop stuff (building projects)

**This is not for business.** This is for individuals who have an interest in building things at a personal level and looking for other who do the same... Both to get help and to give help.

As an example, I like my wood working shop. It's small but functional. I haven't built a whole lot, my last couple projects were mostly restoring tools (Table saws/jointers/sanders) Restored a couple pieces of vintage furniture. Built a table that sits behind the couch and a new countertop for the workbench in the shop.

I have a bunch of arduino stuff, but haven't got too far with it (But I do have projects I want to make)

I have a metal lathe and milling machine that I fully restored and a 3d printer and CNC machine that I built from scratch. I have made lots of signs and plaques. Repaired things with the 3d printer. Design my own parts when required.

The projects I make are mostly for fun, but I do make a couple to sell once in awhile.

I'm not sure if I am willing to continually run any sort of group (it's not my thing really - I'm actually a very quiet person) But I don't mind starting one. (If there is interest in keeping a group active, maybe you you could help with that?) - I'll put a few together if the first one goes well.

For me, I'd like to meet a few people with some common interests, build some friendships. Brainstorm and work on projects together outside of any work.

\-----

So if this sounds like something you'd be interested in, please let me know.

Okay, cool, till then!

VictoriaBC,iReturnVidyatapes,"How does Victoria differ from Vancouver in terms of style, personality, and drug addiction? Never been to the city so I'm unsure. I've seen some photos and videos of it and from what I gather, it feels like a ""big small town"" which leads me to believe the vibe is a lot more relaxed and less rat racey as Vancouver is. Is this the case? Are people easier to talk to? Are they friendlier and more open than Vancouverites?

The architecture looks more reminiscent of England than it does a modern city like Toronto or New York. In that regard, does it feel more like you're talking through a European city in the same sense that Montreal and Quebec city feels like you're living in a European city?

Lastly, how is the drug scene there? Is the city as lenient towards drug addicts as Vancouver seems to be? Because the first time I saw Hastings, I just could not believe my eyes. I've never seen anything like that in any city in all of Canada. Is Victoria cleaner than Vancouver in regards to drugs? 

On a lesser note, how well does Victoria go out of their way to celebrate Christmas? Are they as festive as other major cities like Toronto and Montreal? Does it have any animated Christmas windows? Lights adorned on the sidewalks? I heard you guys had several ""Christmas shops"" scattered around the city which are now all gone. I'm hoping this didn't put a crimp in the cities festive spirit.

VictoriaBC,ialwaysknow557,"Looking for information for incident at cook street park Saturday September 17, 2022 I’m looking for information regarding an incident that happened at Cook St., Park on September 17 around 2:00/3:00 o’clock in the afternoon. My kids were at their dads for the weekend, and him, his girlfriend, her child and two of our children (8&10) went to Cook St., Park. The girlfriend and her daughter were at the swings and my ex and our two kids were doing a workout at that park. 

When they were done with this workout they went into the merry go round. At some point a lady entered the park with two kids and she was already yelling at those two kids. The vibe had changed a little bit and some people left, and the kids were just on the merry-go-round playing as usual. At some point those two boys wanted to join into the merry go round and they went into the merry go round. So my ex just spun them a few times before he got tired and then said to my kids play on your own, we will leave shortly I’m going to see my girlfriend. So he walked over to his girlfriend and started swinging her daughter. 

And my kids just played around for a bit but then the older boy called my middle one a name. To which my son replied you’re too young to call people a name. Then they started walking towards their dad and the oldest boy started throwing wood chips and trying to hit my son while also trying to hit him. My son didn’t do anything in return until the third time that that boy threw wood chips at my son again then my son threw wood chips back at the boy and then walked to his dad. The other boy had also said that you better be careful because we have a shotgun at the house. 

Now that my ex, his girlfriend and all three kids were together all of a sudden this lady comes running up to them calling my ex a drunk, calling my exes girlfriend a crackhead (they are both completely sober) and just started ranting, saying she should call the police and starts recording on her phone (a video I presume). the girlfriend yelled back at her and told her to back off to which she did and then proceeded to type on her phone vigorously. 

My ex and his girlfriend decided they were going to leave the park so they got their stuff together and walked to the car and this lady followed them and took a picture of the license plate. My ex takes my minivan when he has the kids to make it easier for transportation. So they leave and that’s it, nothing else happens. 

Now I am home alone cleaning my kitchen having a few drinks playing loud music and just enjoying a night with no kids. All of a sudden there is a lady at my front door she asks my for my address she asked for my name and then she informed me that she’s here from social services. She asked if I was a Beacon Hill Park which I’m guessing she meant Cook Street park and I said no because the kids are with dad and she said oh that makes sense we need to have a chat. It has so happened that someone has filed a very serious report with social services about domestic violence. So I’m stressing out not really believing that this is happening and just going insane and I proceed to give her the address of my ex where my kids are and she informed me that I need to get ready to pick up my kids. So she goes over to my exes house sees that my kids are fine my ex is fine there is no indication whatsoever that there’s any type of abuse which by the way I would never send my kids into an abusive relationship situation ever. And when the social worker called me back when she left their house she said that somebody had filed a very malicious report that was obviously false. So after talking to my ex, to my kids and to my exes girlfriend and getting the story we are very upset with all this happening while there was absolutely no cause for this to happen. 

The next morning I wake up because I got a phone call from the police and he identified himself he wanted to get information and I said oh are you just following up on the social services to which he replied I don’t know what you mean and as I tell him the story he’s like what I don’t have any social services report or need or have an indication social services needed to be present. This lady had obviously filed 2 (different) reports.  It was anonymously filed to social services.  

I am looking for anybody who might have witnessed this confrontation and have any idea who this lady is because I would like this lady charged with making a false report about my family and there could’ve been such serious consequences for such a malicious report. Apparently she had said that my ex had grabbed his girlfriends hair and smashed her face into a post or a wall, or something and then turned on our son and beat him so hard that he was bleeding and had bruises all over. Now the amount of stress that we all went through on a Saturday night and this Sunday still reeling from this very serious accusation is incomprehensible to me and I would like to figure this out so this lady will not do this to any other families that live in Victoria so please if you do have any information contact me and I will do something about it. There’s absolutely no abuse in our household we work well together as coparents and his girlfriend is a great person to be in my kids lives and we are all professionals in one way or another and this could’ve been so bad and my kids were so upset with having a social worker there at night for such an unsubstantiated complaint.

If you just want to learn how to reduce your risk of catching COVID-19, scroll down to the ""Risk Reduction"" section. However, to appreciate the full scope of the challenge ahead, you are encouraged to carefully read this entire document, which will be updated regularly as long as it stays on the front page of your sub.

The aim of this document is simple: it's best to walk into something knowing what you're about to face. It also aims to reduce anxiety, panic, and misinformation by arming you with key sourced information, all without downplaying the risks of COVID-19.

The document has gone through hundreds of iterations thanks to global community feedback, including from places such as Seattle, LA, Australia, and Canada. Although all facts are meticulously sourced from experts in their fields, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. 

Further, contextualization of information remains an ongoing challenge, as does keeping up with a fluid situation. Final word will always belong to the health authorities, as well as the mods of this subreddit.

Now brace yourself, because this is going to suck a little bit.

#**CONTEXT:**

A recent in-depth [study](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2002/2002.03268.pdf) has shown just how incredibly infectious COVID-19 is. Unfortunately, its spread [has not slowed](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fe4uza/how_would_you_visualize_the_evolution_of/), and the virus has only been halted through stringent physical distancing measures.

In other words, and as the Director of the WHO himself has [said](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1235635005415739393), this is not a drill.

**The bad news:** There are currently well over [a million](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) global confirmed cases of COVID-19, and the WHO has classified it as a pandemic. Now it seems that it has arrived upon your doorstep, which means there is likely exponential and silent human-to-human transmission in the community.

**The good news:** knowledge is a weapon that defeats these things. It worked in 1918 against the Spanish Flu, when we essentially stopped the medieval practice of blood-letting (you know when they drained you of blood because they thought that would cure whatever ailed you? Or leeching?). And it worked against many other outbreaks since: Smallpox, MERS, SARS, Ebola, etc. The WHO's tackling of Smallpox alone was nothing short of scientific heroism.

And so, a hundred years after 1918, here we are again, facing perhaps the [greatest test of our generation](https://twitter.com/Channel4News/status/1235994748005085186).

The problem is that these days we're inundated with so much information that, when a real threat comes along, it's buried under a mountain of clutter. And although this document is not all-encompasing by any means, hopefully it will help you see through some of that clutter, as well as give those new to the threat an opportunity to hit the ground running.

So go ahead and meet [your foe](https://i.imgur.com/okCsxd1.jpg). Do not underestimate it. 

Now prepare to go to war.

#**IMPORTANT:**

* **The main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets: coughing, sneezing, [talking](https://www.newsweek.com/speaking-can-transmit-coronavirus-due-tiny-droplets-saliva-nih-study-suggests-1496719), and breathing.** But you can also get it through shaking hands, kissing somebody who is sick, or touching a contaminated surface (droplet dispersion; think of a cough plume settling). This can include handrails, doorknobs, elevator buttons, and surfaces prone to a droplet dispersion cloud. ""Cough dispersion"" basically means anytime a sick person coughs, they're dispering a plume of droplets over a given area. The viral particles within those droplets then settle on ordinary surfaces. People touch those surfaces then touch their phones or their faces, which in turn lead to contact with their eyes, mouth, or nose, inducing infection. Therefore it is best to keep a 6 ft ""coughing distance"" from people, and treat everything you touch in public as if it's been contaminated (see the ""Risk Reduction"" section below). **[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bI5pQGXl2o&feature=youtu.be) an excellent short video on the topic. [Here's another one](https://vimeo.com/402577241).

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT GAINING [ACCEPTANCE](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/health/coronavirus-how-it-spreads.html?0p19G=2870) IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** There now appears to be evidence the virus can spread through breathing. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota: **""The findings [of the study] confirm that COVID-19 is spread simply through breathing, even without coughing. Don't forget about hand washing, but at the same time we've got to get people to understand that if you don't want to get infected, you can't be in crowds. Social distancing is the most effective tool we have right now.""** [Source.](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/03/study-highlights-ease-spread-covid-19-viruses) (Crucial to understand: the research specifies patients who are symptomatic, and makes no claims about asymptomatic transfer.) **UPDATE:** [Dr. Osterholm just went on the Joe Rogan show to explain the situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3URhJx0NSw). Although the show itself has been known to be controversial, the Doctor's [credentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Osterholm) speak for themselves.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW]** A new study indicates COVID-19 can survive in the air for up to 3 hours, and several days on surfaces, depending on the surface (up to 3 days on plastic, up to 2 days on metal, up to 1 day on cardboard). ([Article](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/487110-tests-indicate-coronavirus-can-survive-in-the-air) | [Study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf)). [Here's a shadowgraph imaging](https://media.wired.com/clips/5e6a65157c07c90008d05257/360p/pass/PLoS-video-V3.mp4) of people breathing ([source](https://www.wired.com/story/they-say-coronavirus-isnt-airborne-but-its-definitely-borne-by-air/)). Unfortunately it is a bit misleading as it does not show drop dispersion, but gets the point across.

* **[AWAITING PEER REVIEW, BUT GAINING ACCEPTANCE IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY]** New analysis seems to indicate infected people without symptoms might be driving the spread of coronavirus more than we realized (CNN [link](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/health/coronavirus-asymptomatic-spread/index.html), with links to multiple studies in the article). This is corroborated by Dr. Norman Swan on March 14th, via ABC Australia, who says ""you *are* infectious *before* the symptoms come out, there's no question about that."" The WHO says you are infectious for about 48 hours prior to showing first symptoms. (Source 1: Dr. Swan: see minute mark 4:02 in [this health alert video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-15/dr-norman-swan-recommends-proactive-national-lockdown/12057956)), ([Source 2](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-most-contagious-before-during-first-week-symptoms)). **ALERT: It is now generally believed that this is the reason the virus is taking so many communities by surprise: it spreads during that crucial asymptomatic/low-symptom stage.** 

* **WARNING:** March 16th Article, based on fresh research: ""80% of COVID-19 spreads from people who don't know they are sick"" ( [Article](https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/03/16/80-of-COVID-19-spreads-from-people-who-dont-know-they-are-sick/7771584372104/?ds=5) | [Study](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221) | [Discussion 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fjntyc/substantial_undocumented_infection_facilitates/) | [Discussion 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjre8d/80_of_covid19_spreads_from_people_who_dont_know/) )

* **WARNING: We are past containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures. [A short GIF](https://i.imgur.com/KpJWSm4.gif) on how we stop the virus from spreading.** 

* **Up to 1 in 5 infected people may require hospitalization** [source 1](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf), [source 2](https://medium.com/@amwren/forget-about-the-death-rate-this-is-why-you-should-be-worried-about-the-coronavirus-890fbf9c4de6). But this is an oversimplification as the metric skews toward the elderly and those with comorbidities (see the Mortality/Comorbidities section below). Plus the metrics differ based on [region and testing capacity](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/10/simple-math-alarming-answers-covid-19/). [Excellent short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOJqHPfG7pA&feature=youtu.be) on the topic.

* Here's a breakdown of the above: Approximately 80% of laboratory confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, which includes non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases. 13.8% have had severe disease requiring hospitalization, and 6.1% were critical, requiring the ICU (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure). (These numbers are as of Feb 20, 2020, based on 55,924 laboratory confirmed cases in China, from the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf).)
 **Update:** European Society of Intensive Care Medicine is reporting a 10% ICU rate, and has [issued a word of warning](https://twitter.com/marcelsalathe/status/1235662457261023232).

* Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, **the danger is not just the mortality rate for the vulnerable, but the possibility of overwhelming the health infrastructure, which in turn causes unnecessary fatalities.** 

* As it stands, it wouldn't take much to overwhelm hospitals, hence why it's important to start taking preventative measures now (outlined in the Risk Reduction section below)—especially because hospitals are already burdened with a heavy flu season (in the Northern hemisphere, that is). For example, if only 10 out of every 1000 people required a bed, we'd already be coming up short, as in the USA there are only [2.77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds for every 1000 people, and [2.58](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) in Canada. Why is this important? **In South Korea, 4 in 22 deaths happened while waiting to be hospitalized** ([source](https://n.news.naver.com/article/005/0001294063) in Korean, as well as a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fbxm0s/south_korea_4_in_22_deaths_happened_while_waiting/) about it), and that's from South Korea, who is #2 in the world bedcount-wise with [12.27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_OECD_countries_by_hospital_beds) beds per 1000 people. And of course many beds will already be occupied for regular patients.

#**PSYCHOLOGY:**

* Do not panic, but give yourself permission to feel fear. [Fear gets you prepared](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm). As for panic, all one has to do is look at the crowded halls of Wuhan hospitals during the early phases of the outbreak to understand how panic worsens problems. A jolt of fear is all right, as it gets you moving in the right direction. After that point, however, you must turn to thinking clearly, level-headedly, and listen to your local health authorities. As for what you can do, follow the steps in the ""Risk Reduction"" section below.

* Ignoring this threat will only make it worse, as it preys on your underestimation of it. That underestimation may cost you your life, or the life of a loved one.

* Upon first learning about the extent of the threat, you may become anxious and hyper aware and start taking extra pecautions. This is normal, what psychologists call an *adjustment reaction*. [A short guide on how to cope](http://www.psandman.com/col/teachable.htm).

* [Normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias) plays a factor. So does denial. You may hear things like ""it's just a flu, nothing to worry about."" It is [dangerously inaccurate](https://www.propublica.org/article/this-coronavirus-is-unlike-anything-in-our-lifetime-and-we-have-to-stop-comparing-it-to-the-flu) to compare COVID-19 to the flu. Facing the threat will help you prepare for it while denial puts you and your loved ones at risk. People in denial may take foolish risks like attend crowded events during an active outbreak, or fail to take precautionary measures, thereby accidentally passing the virus on to others. Denial also slows community response.

* [Here is an excellent Harvard piece](https://nieman.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/pod-assets/microsites/NiemanGuideToCoveringPandemicFlu/CrisisCommunication/HowDoPeopleReactInAPandemic.aspx.html) on reactions and overreactions, denial versus panic, and the five principle bulwarks against denial. It is short and absolutely worth your time.

* For officials, [crisis management teaches us](http://www.psandman.com/col/fear.htm) that it is important not to downplay a threat, otherwise you may lose the public's trust. Do not fear inducing a panic (see the aforementioned paper). The public needs you to be clear, informative, competent, and proactive. Studies such as [this one](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/208354) about the 1918 pandemic have shown just how effective a proactive approach can be on the part of leadership. But [look what can happen](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/philadelphia-threw-wwi-parade-gave-thousands-onlookers-flu-180970372/) on the other end of the spectrum.

#**RISK REDUCTION:**

Think of those in your life who are vulnerable (see the Comorbidities section). If not for yourself, do it for them.

* **To reiterate, we are *past* containment. It is now vital to [flatten the curve](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-flatten-the-curve.html) and implement physical distancing measures.**

* Practice [physical distancing](https://globalnews.ca/news/6652654/social-distancing-coronavirus/). Here's [why it works](http://smaldino.com/wp/covid-19-modeling-the-flattening-of-the-curve/). An excellent [visual](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) example of why it works.

* Do not touch your face

* After *every* outing, [wash your hands](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fmjbsk/washing_your_hands_is_more_effective_than_hand/) and disinfect your phone (the virus can likely [live up to 96 hours on phone screens](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone/)). And you're probably washing your hands wrong. [Here's a short 1.5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PmVJQUCm4E) by the WHO. 

* Carry disinfectant with you. But if you don't have any, know that soap works better than alcohol and disinfectants at destroying the structure of viruses ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/deadly-viruses-are-no-match-for-plain-old-soap-heres-the-science-behind-it-2020-03-08?reflink=mw_share_facebook))

* Do not shake hands.

* While in public, try to keep a coughing distance from people, which is *at least* 6 feet.

* Treat everything you touch in public as a contaminated surface.

* If you use a travel mug, be sure to disinfect it after *every* outing.

* Disinfect doorknobs and often-touched places, especially keyboards and phones. Also disinfect reusable shopping bags, wallets, keys.

* Take initiative and disinfect doorknobs and elevator buttons in your building. Do not wait for management to do it for you.

* Keep disinfectant by every entrance to your house. 

* Avoid anyone who is coughing, and [stay away from poorly ventilated places](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20200302_34/). 

* Stay away from crowds. 

* Wear a mask in public when possible ([study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323085/) | [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/fmla3q/sarscov1_frequent_mask_use_in_public_venues/) | [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html))

* Cough into your elbow, or preferably into a tissue that is disposed of into the trash.

* While in public, only touch things with your knuckle, a glove, or your sleeve. Touch elevator buttons with the tip of your key. Wash your gloves often.

* Ask your boss to work from home as many transmissions happen at work.

* There is a global shortage of face masks. If you have extra, be prepared to donate some should the hospitals/care homes send a call out to the community.

* If you have extra bottles of hand-sanitizer, please consider sharing them with those who do not have any. This is about working together, and minimizing community spread helps everyone within the community, including you and your loved ones.

* [Take extra precautions when shopping for groceries, even when buying online.](https://www.consumerreports.org/food-shopping/how-to-protect-yourself-from-coronavirus-when-grocery-shopping/?EXTKEY=EE032IBAC&utm_source=acxiom)

* Have 14 days of food in your home in case you are ordered under quarantine. There's nothing wrong with preparatory shopping in case of quarantine, but be careful not to do this once an outbreak has been declared in your city, as you may be lining up alongside sick people. At that point, it is better to shop at night/off hours, and after taking careful precautions. Or consider ordering your groceries online.

* Don't share a cup. Don't share eating utensils. Don't share a toothbrush. In fact, don't share anything that comes in direct contact with your mouth or nose.

* Keep air circulating. Dispersing droplets can keep you from getting a hefty, infectious dose. Open a window; turn on a fan. ([source](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/05/812570693/how-coronavirus-spreads-a-cough-in-your-face-or-a-kiss-on-your-cheek))

* Use a humidifier. Keeping the humidity up will [keep the protective membranes in your nose from drying out](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583861/), which makes them less effective as they try to keep pathogens out. Mid-range humidity also appears to cause some viruses to decay faster.

* Besides practicing physical distancing, always remember the top three: disinfect your phone, don't touch that ugly face of yours, and wash your filthy hands. After *every* outing. Seriously, if there's *one* thing you take away from this, do these three things. They may just save your life, or the life of a loved one.

* A [nifty GIF](https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Covid-19-curves-graphic-social-v3.gif) to show the importance of taking precautions now.

A CDC guide titled [People at Higher Risk for COVID-19 Complications](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html) expounds on the point.

#**MORTALITY RATE:**

(As of 20 February 2020 and based on 55,924 laboratory-confirmed cases in China as per the [WHO report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). Please note mortality will differ from region to region based on regional comorbidities, as well as a host of other variables such as healthcare infrastructure, response measures taken, etc.)

#**ADDITIONALS:**

* The Average time from first symptoms to death is estimated to be 18 days ([source paper](https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/nCoV-public/analyses/first_adjusted_mortality_estimates_and_risk_assessment/2019-nCoV-preliminary_age_and_time_adjusted_mortality_rates_and_pandemic_risk_assessment.html)). Again, the metrics skew toward comorbidities.

* But even as a young person you want to avoid COVID-19, and not only because you could pass it on to vulnerable others, but because experts don't know what the longterm side effects are. And then there's the potential of suffering.

Why I created this post:

I've done the best job I could giving the sources context. I've asked the public and some medical professionals to weigh in, and have adjusted the document based on what they have said. But to reiterate, you are responsible for your own health and your own research. I'm just a volunteer who's put countless hours into this as I have a particular communicative and collative skillset that I suspected could be of benefit in this ordeal—that and I've been following COVID-19 closely since mid-January.

And now the beast is upon my doorstep, and I too have susceptible loved ones around me.

The aim of this document was to inform without minimizing risk. Accurate information reduces panic and anxiety and helps people make the right decisions in a difficult time. I hope it succeeded in that regard, and that you found it useful. 

Yet there's always room for improvement, so feel free to constructively suggest changes (but if you're going to be a jerk about it, you will simply be blocked and ignored, and that's that). If you have a trustworthy more up-to-date source on an old metric of mine, please leave it in the comments. Also you are welcome to suggest alternative word/sentence choice changes. 

As I mentioned in the intro, this document went through many versions. Thank you to those from all around the world who had constructively weighed in to make it a more robust and useful PSA. 

Other communities are invited to post a link to the source doc in the [Canada sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/fghd23/psa_regarding_covid19_a_warning/), which will be kept up to date (as will any PSA I posted myself, as long as it's still on the main page of your sub).

My very best wishes from Victoria, BC, Canada, and good luck to us all.

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"A Primer on attending Pacific FC Games at Starlight Stadium (and why you should go) Hey all. I posted this as a response [in the other thread about the fellow who attended his first PFC game](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/p8lt8s/went_to_my_first_pacific_fc_game_tonight_which/), but I thought maybe start it as a new thread for those on the fence about going to the games, and to tell you what to expect at the games. It's really a great and fun experience for all the family, for adults, for couples, for casual fans and serious fans. I'd also be happy to answer any questions you might have about Pacific FC, Starlight Stadium, and attending the games. NB - I am not associated with the team other than being a fan and season ticket holder.

PS - EDIT - thanks for the gold whoever gave it! Appreciate it!

Here goes.

I'm a season ticket holder since day one (I was actually #152 on the wait list once the team was announced), and I love the experience and atmosphere at the games. I've also gotten to know the staff, management and a lot of the players very well over the first three (kinda 2) seasons of this new team. 

So a few things to note, my fellow Victorians:

* **This is essentially a 2nd year brand new league** so you're not going to be watching Everton v. Liverpool type matches. It is a Tier 1 FIFA league which means the sky is the limit long term, but it will take decades of steady growth and development to get to MLS / Mexican League level game play.

* **Passion is on the Field** My previous point made, everyone on the field plays their guts out. The players are passionate and focused. You simply don't see players mailing it in. They play to, and beyond their skill level.

* **Best stadium experience in the Canadian Premier League**... frankly by far. The most intimate stadium, you're right there at the action, and pitchside you can probably reach out and give the players a high five (don't do that during the game). Most of the stadium is brand new, the seats are comfortable for what they are, and there's no bad seat in the place. Management has no problems with fans moving from their seats to the supporters section or the beer garden (see below). 

* **Incredible value for season tickets**. We have main grandstand seats so they're more expensive, but you can get [general admission end zone season tickets](https://pacificfc.canpl.ca/2021-season-tickets) for $204 seat (and even cheaper now as it would be prorated for the remaining games).  That includes 14 games plus the 'caps game, includes a subscription to OneSoccer (to watch all the games stream style), 50% off a team jersey and other perks. That's a crazy fantastic value. My last season tickets for the Whitecaps were $750ish per seat and that was 6 years ago.

* **Players, Coaches, Staff all super approachable** All the players are approachable and available pre and post games, they know the fans are there 100% for them, and they show it. Players often mill around after the game, taking photos and chatting with the fans. There's no snobbery here.

* **Management goes many extra meters** Saw something amazing at last night's game. The people sitting behind us - two parents and their son - are also season ticket holders. Kid is a super fan, parents just getting into it. I told Brad Norris-Jones, the GM about them last week, so he came to say hi to them after the game, and took the kid with him backstage (I think to the locker room). Kid came back 5 mins later with a **game ball signed by entire team**. He's going to be a fan for life.

* **Eight Team League, scheduled to be 10 teams by 2023**... also, the plan is to be a 16 team league by 2028. Word is, with Saskatchewan coming in in 2023, a Lower Mainland team is also coming in, which would be a fantastic rivalry team set up for PFC in a few years.

* **Decent food and concession prices** Prices aren't insane for beer, drinks, food at the game. There needs to be more food trucks though, and that's 100% on the laziness of the food truck operators. 

* **Beer Garden Pitch Side** Yup, a beer garden (and DJ booth) both pitch side, next to the player benches. Anyone with a ticket can go and watch from there.

* **Easy Access via Highway, Lots of Parking** Very easy access off the main highway (take Exit 16, turn left at the lights on the offramp, then just stay on that road until you come to the stadium). Parking's all free too. 

* **Weekends: Pre Game Tailgating Encouraged!** Pre game tailgate parties are encouraged and very chill in terms of allowing the enjoyment of the beverage of your choice (be cool about it). BBQs going, one of the supporter groups -- TOP - charges $10 for all you can eat (they bring the meat!). Really fun atmosphere.

I'm kind of shocked that the team is only getting 2,500-3,000 for a game. You folks not attending don't know what you're missing. If you're thinking of attending and have questions, fire away. If I can't answer, I can find someone who can.",Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness ,0,False,24.444444444444443
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Any tips for running a successful (but really small) urban farm stand in front of your house in Victoria? After kind of dreaming about it for years now, I think I'm ready to take the plunge and finally have my own little urban farm stand in front of my house in Victoria proper.

I produce a lot from my relatively small produce garden (125sq.ft. of beds, about 20 grow bags here and there) and always end up freezing, canning, preserving stuff in the fall, to the point now where our basement storage area is literally chock full of hundreds of cans of preserves from the past several years. 

Been doing my research, (for instance I don't believe I need city permission to have a small produce stand on my property in Victoria - Saanich is another matter), and I'll operate it on a trust system (locked cash draw with slot), and also include my interac address for interac payments. 

**But I'm looking for ideas, tips and advice on how to make it successful from others who have been doing this for a while.**

Also had a few questions (Victoria specific)

- can I sell baked goods? (I have a wicked herbs flatbread cracker recipe and was thinking of making those for the stand). 

- I think I can sell preserves / jams / jellies no problem, but are there any limitations on other prepared / preserved foods I can sell? (for instance, I make my own mayonnaise, and was mulling doing up a ""craft"" mayo for the stand, like sundried tomato mayo, or japanese mayo) (ps - I think the answer to that is no, but hopefully someone who knows more than I do about this process knows the correct answer)

- one thing I've never seen in an urban produce / farm stand is someone selling seeds. I harvest seeds from all my crops each year, and have literally hundreds of thousands of them from lettuce to tomato and everything in between. Would selling seed packets even work?","Victoria Women in Need, Victoria Women's Transition House",0,False,12.5
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Be careful out there, especially in a car... Waking up this morning, we got a good dump of snow in Victoria. I was born and raised in Ottawa and did the first 10 years of my driving there; besides having good snow tires we'd change over to in November (not many Victorians have snow tires, I've seen), my driving lessons from Young Drivers of Canada come back to me. Simple, common sense things:

* **Triple the distance**. When the roads are this snowy and potentially icy, give triple the distance you normally would between cars, when moving, when slowing down, when turning, and when stopped at a light. 

* **Use your car's low gears**. Most cars including automatics have low gear modes, or tiptronic, or what have you, and this is the time to make use of these; they often provide better access to the car's overall control, especially on inclines.

* **Make sure your traction control - edit - stability control - is on.** Most modern cars have ~~traction~~ stability control, which is a must have in these kinds of conditions. They can prevent your wheels from sliding. 

* **Slow starts from stops**. If your tendency is to gun the throttle   from a standing start (like a red light turning green), it just won't work here, and your car is likely to go sideways. Get the car into the lowest gear you can, and ease off the brake, letting the idle take over and slowly give it gas as you start moving. 

* **Know how to deal with a front wheel skid**. Many modern cars are front wheel drive, so this is a common problem. In these conditions, this is almost guaranteed to happen, so don't panic, stay calm, and stay off the brakes and gas if it happens as much as you can. If you start feeling the front wheels skidding and sliding, ease off the gas, don't go for the brakes, and let the tires gain traction, then steer in the direction you want to go. Once you feel there's solid traction again, then use the brakes or gas pedal depending on the situation.

* **Know how to deal with a back wheel skid**. If you find you've lost the back end of your car and it's starting to spin, again, don't panic, don't go for the brakes or gas in a crazy way. Correct the skid: ease off the gas, turn into the slide to straighten the car, and don't over steer. Once your steering is pointing the same way your car is, you're back in control and you can then get out of the situation you've found yourself in.

And lastly... the most important tip:

**Clean all the snow off your car's roof, hood and trunk, and scrape all the ice off all the windows before driving**. A roof full of snow is a major hazard to others on the roadway. And given these conditions, you need the max visibility you can get.

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Best Flood Preparation Advice I have, with the 3 atmospheric rivers coming. Having more than a little experience with floods, both here in Victoria and also in Ontario, by far the best prep advice I can give is

First, buy yourself a utility surface pump ([like this one](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/everbilt-1-6-hp-portable-submersible-utility-pump/1000668924)) and get about 30' or longer of garden hose with it. It's just plain peace of mind, and will do 95% of the labour for you if you do see flooding in your home basement or other areas. They typically work in as little as 15mm of water, and can move up to 1500 gallons an hour. The last flood, we had two of them (one in reserve) and I have a flowmeter on the hose, and saw at one point it was moving about 500 gallons per hour. In the past, we'd have to move this water manually with a shop vac and other methods. These little $100 pumps can potentially save tens of thousands of dollars in flood damage repair costs. 

Second, buy yourself a cheap small gas or dual fuel electric generator. This is your last resort backup if your sump is going like crazy, and you're running a surface pump, and something takes out the electrical power in your house. Use these to power the sump and surface pumps, some light in your work area (if it's a dark basement at night), and even your fridge and freezers. You can buy new ones pushing 3500W or more for under $500; or look for a good condition used one - we found a 5000W Honda for $250 several years back. Have had it fired up a few times (good idea to run it several times a year), but have not yet had to use it in an emergency. Still, the peace of mind that it's there is massive.","Emergency Housing , Point in Time",0,False,0.0

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Does Victoria (and Vancouver Island) have a drinking and driving problem? Seeking perspective from my own story here. Maybe we just have too many friends (Vancouver Island born) who don't think it's a big deal. I had a dear cousin of mine killed by a drunk driver, so I'm really biased against it.

I have noticed, since moving here 5 years ago, there is a much more lax mentality for getting behind the wheel after having several drinks.

We've hosted BBQs, Movie Nights (indoor and outdoor) and social events over the years, and for our friends who are not from Vancouver Island, responsible actions are typically taken - one person doesn't drink in a couple so they can drive home, or they call a cab, or limit themselves to one beer over the 2-4 hour event.

But some (a few) of the VI folks... 3, 4, 5+ beers at a BBQ then say they're fine for driving home. In five very specific cases I recall, as host, I put my foot down and said no, you're calling a cab, or we'll drive you home (my wife doesn't drink). I've tried to be as respectful and kind about it as I could. Yet in 2 of those cases, a big enough argument ensued that these people are no longer our friends, and TBH, one couple who were responsible for 2 of the other cases have not attended any of our get togethers this summer (in the past they usually always attend); I can only surmise they didn't like being told to be responsible.

When we started doing these social gatherings soon after we moved to Victoria, it wouldn't cross my mind to ""police"" drinking and driving at our social events, because in Vancouver, we didn't have to. But after a year or so here, I realised I had to be more vocal about it after seeing some pretty blatant disregard for getting behind the wheel after having a six pack.

In the past few years now - we make it known now that if you're coming to one of our BBQs or outdoor movie nights at our home, you have to have a drive home plan; either one person is the DD, or you take public transport / cab home if you're drinking. Because of this, less of our Vancouver Island friend network come; most of our regular ""born off the Island"" friends still show up though, no problem.

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Dr. Henry needs to make masks mandatory in all public spaces indoors (shopping, services, etc). I was very disappointed in many things today regarding the news and rise in COVID cases in BC and on the Island. But I think I was most disappointed in Dr. Henry's commentary on why she isn't mandating masks for all indoor businesses. 

In a nutshell, she said ""many businesses have done it voluntarily, and they all have to follow existing health guidelines, and if they cannot maintain proper social distance, already must enforce a mask policy in the cases where proper social distance cannot be maintained..."" She went on further to say it's up to businesses to mandate masks etc etc.

Here's the thing. I'm quite pro mask. Even if it helps reduce COVID infections by a measly 5% (of course, universal mask wearing would reduce infections by a much higher number), it's worth it. It's a very basic sacrifice for us all to do for the common good.

So I tend to only shop and do business at places with mandatory mask policies these days. Some times, I cannot, and do go into a business without mandatory rules. In every circumstance since August, I've asked to speak to the manager, and asked why they do not have a mandatory mask policy. (not every visit, but certainly every business I've asked at least once).

The answer is almost always the same. It goes like this:

""We do not have a mandatory mask policy because BC Health has not mandated it. When they do, we will of course follow that rule"". 

Businesses like Thrifty's, Save on Foods, Shoppers Drug Mart, etc etc are all putting their staff at risk with these policies. **These are front line workers, often making minimum wage** so you can get your lifes' necessities. These companies **will not do the right thing for their staff** or customers, appeasing the tiny minority who simply don't give a fuck about anyone but themselves. So if they won't do it, Dr. Henry has to do it. 

It's only going to get worse folks.

In the meantime, I continue to support businesses that have mask requirements in Victoria and the region, and avoid those that do not. My spending at Thrifty's (my local grocery store) has gone down probably 85% in the past six months because of their mask policy. Now Walmart gets all my grocery money, and trust me, I'm not happy about that.

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Finally starting to understand ""Island Time"" (aka Victoria Time, aka always a bit late) So when my wife and moved to Victoria from the mainland 2.5 years ago, our friends over here cautioned us to get to used to Island Time™ quick, or be frustrated. I'm a stickler for being on time, but my wife isn't, so, well, that is what it was. And when we settled here and started making appointments, schedules, meeting times, etc etc, I did notice that a lot of folks are indeed ""lax"" with regards to the times they actually show up. Especially for more casual things, but also noticed it on trips we took, meetup times in different towns, etc etc. Selling something on Used Victoria and person says they'll be by at 4? That could mean 4:30, 4:45, 5pm even.

Seems the only things that aren't strictly on Island Time™ are visits to the doctor (their medical office assistants get very uppity) and the ferry. Busses on schedule? meh, Island Time™. Start of the hockey game? Island Time™. Saturday afternoon gardening class? Island Time™.

I'm getting used to it, but I think I also figured out one of the causes (of many). I notice -- and I do it myself -- that everyone seems to under estimate how much time is needed to get from point A to point B here. It seems ingrained that most trips are 10-15 minutes max. Oh, going from Capital Iron downtown to Oak Bay? 10 minutes. Going from Cattle Point to Uptown? 10 minutes! Going from Cook and Quadra to View Royal? 10 minutes man!  But reality is, some trips in and around the CRD take (gasp!) 20 minutes, 25 minutes, even more! But I have this mentality in my head that, unlike Vancouver where many routine trips are 20, 30, 45 minutes these days with all the traffic, here in Victoria, everything's a 10 minute trip in a car. There's some Island Time™ going on.

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Following up to the ""Compliments Cheese"" thread about getting great cheese on the cheap on Vancouver Island. There is another thread where a fellow recommended [buying the Compliments Extra Old cheese on sale at Thriftys this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/e9yipz/psa_thrifty_compliment_cheese/). 

TL:DR: Buy whole wheel of gouda cheese for $1.20/100g or less. Age it yourself. Enjoy $4+/100g equivalent cheese with not much effort. Some minor investment required.

I'm a serious cheese nerd, and one of the things I knew I'd be sacrificing a bit by moving to Victoria (from Vancouver) several years back was giving up some of my hunted-down cheapo sources of actual GOOD cheese I knew of in Vancouver. I do make my own cheese at home, but it's usually soft, low-age stuff; I don't have the time or patience to make a firm cheese, plus finding a decent priced milk to use for making great firmed cheeses at home is very difficult here on the Island.

So here's a super pro tip for Victorians and folks on the Island for getting fantastic cheese at less than $1.50/100g, and as little as $1.09/100g. The caveat is, you absolutely need either a vacseal machine (non FoodSaver models, like FreshSeal can be bought on Amazon for under $40), or some beeswax, and ideally also need a cold storage / cool basement / dark place with airflow and temperatures below 15C spot in your home.

For my go-to cheese, I usually wait until Thriftys has the wheels of Frico Medium or Mild Gouda on for their super-sales. If buying the entire wheel, you can get the mild for as little as $1.09/100g (which is cheaper than any of the no name bricks of cheese, though last time the wheels were on sale, it was $1.29/100g), and the medium for as little as $1.45/100g (up to $1.59/kg). A typical wheel is 4.5kg to 5kg, so the Mild Frico Gouda is around $60 a wheel, and the Medium is around $75ish or less.

And here's the kicker. You can continue to age the whole wheels. You can basically turn the mild (young) gouda into a medium or old, simply by unwrapping it from any plastic, and placing the wheel in a clean, well ventilated part of your basement or cold storage that's preferably under 15C. The only effort on your part is turning the cheese wheels over every week or two to keep the moisture inside the cheese circulating (and not settling on the bottom). Or you can pick up a  UsedVictoria tiny bar fridge for $35, and run it at it's highest temperature setting (ie, just barely on), as long as the cheese temperature is between 7C and 15C. Just remember to open and close the door a few times each day to circulate some air. Again, flip the wheel every week or two.

Currently in the basement of our 1912 home, I have 3 of those Frico mild gouda cheese wheels -- all bought during different Thrifty sales -- aging on a shelf, near where some regular drafty airflow happens. One's over 2 years old now (since I bought it), and we're cutting into it finally this Christmas. We've just finished up a wheel we cut into in August, that had aged for over a year in our basement, and it tastes absolutely fantastic.

What about once you cut into a wheel, breaking the wax seal? You have two options, but some advice first: always cut the wheel in half first, and then cut your slice off one of the halves. It's easier to work with halves and quarters of a wheel than it is working with a full wheel with a slice cut out of it. Always use clean hands too when handling the cheese. Like scrubbed clean. And a cheese wire is the best way to cut these wheels - you'll struggle with a chef knife.

Now, what to do when you cut into a wheel:

First, get a vac seal machine, and vacseal the half wheel, then vacaseal the other half wheel you cut a slice out of. The wheel will no longer ""age"", but will be safe for storage in your regular refrigerator. When you need a new slice of cheese, open the half wheel you cut a slice from, cut another, and seal up that half wheel (which will be closer to a quarter wheel at this point) for long term storage. I used this method for several years and it worked fine; I've never had mold problems from vacsealed cheese wheels I cut into and handled with clean hands and utensils.

Or second, invest in some beeswax (search the internet for cheese making supplies in Canada), research some basics about storing cheese, and re-wax your half wheel and quarter wheels, and put them back in their aging spots, where the cheese will continue to age and develop flavours. This is my current method of sectioning and curing the cheese better. (quick tips: use beeswax, heat it to about 250F to help prevent any mold growth, and dip the cheese in for about 6 seconds; do a second dip at 165F once the first dip has cooled - but google this shit to find out more).

Doing this keeps us stocked in cheese we bought, usually below $1.20/100g, but delivers us cheese other people pay up to $4+/100g for. 

And this cheese tastes WAY WAY BETTER than any of the bulky, Saputo-made crap in major grocery stores here in Victoria.",Safe Supply ,0,False,31.25
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Haven't got a clue who to vote for tomorrow (with a few exceptions). I've been trying to research candidates and decide who to vote for in the Victoria city municipal elections tomorrow, and all I've been able to do is determine who I'm not voting for, so far.

I think I'm a leaning liberal person (I see myself as a liberal libertarian) who does want a good social safety net, some government controls on things like rent, free public transit, a balanced approach to infrastructure (that includes bicycles, but also pays more respect to pedestrians and pedestrian-only areas). I fully support the COVID policies of the province, city and business, and vaccinations. I think $2,000 rents are an obscenity that has been partially caused by shit zoning / approval policies for buildings in the CRD (I'm more looking at the nimbyism in Oak Bay, but Victoria has been very poor on this regard too).

But where I draw the line (and I'm really serious about this) is I do not want any government I pay taxes to be handing out free hard drugs to addicts. And I believe when you commit a crime, you're not the ""victim of your circumstance"" but a criminal and need to pay a price for your crimes. 

That drug hard line I have rules out candidates like Marianne Alto, who in her Reddit AMA specifically stated she wants the province to do just that. I don't want to vote for Stephen because there's aspects of his policies and campaigns I don't agree with, but he's not for handing out government controlled heroin, and he's a lot tougher on crime than Alto is.

Now that I've stated the above, **I will guess this post will be downvoted**, but as a voter, that's my stance. 

Details on most councillor candidates is spotty at best, but the ones that have the most info available seem to be more in the Alto / Isitt areas on drugs and crime than Andrews. They also seem to be very anti-business, which I certainly am not.

I'll do more research tonight, but my question is, what serious candidates are for improving the housing situation, having a more balanced approach to infrastructure and parks, and are more serious about crime and against handing out free drugs.

PS. Am I the only member of this sub who tries to use the flairs? :D

EDIT to add: I do appreciate everyone who's had some discussion in this thread, instead of just knee jerk mashing the vote down button.

Super Edit: After my wife and I did a lot of reading and research this evening, here's the people I think I'm voting for. Convince me why any of these are not a good choice?

Chris Coleman (for CRD too)

~~Matt Dell - wants better parks, I like his concept of the 15 minute neighbourhood~~. Sigh, I was reminded he did an AMA, and he's pro handing out drugs to addicts. That's a red line for me).

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Hillside Walmart is now open - a REVIEW! :p Lots of threads over the last few years about this store. It's finally open this week, and since it's a 1km walk from my house, I went to check it out tonight with my [wheelie grocery cart I bought from Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/radarbulle-shopping-bag-with-wheels-black-70485225/) a few years ago.

First thing I noticed: already, the ""r"" in the ""Walmart"" sign over the north facing entrance wasn't lit up. Like, already?

Not sure what they did to the interior, but it is **small** inside, compared to most Walmarts I've been to. The grocery section is maybe 1/4 as big as the Uptown one, if I'm being generous. It might be 1/5th. Main floor has grocery, and seasonal goods, and things like laundry detergent, paper towels, and the like.

Upstairs is the pharmacy and a yet-unbuilt ""walk in clinic"". Clothes, toys, electronics all upstairs. Again, it's like 1/4 the size of the Uptown one, and seems less than half the size of the Langford one (though the [Times Colonist says its bigger than the Langford Walmart](https://www.timescolonist.com/business/new-hillside-walmart-opens-with-crush-of-shoppers-5488508), I don't believe it).

Which surprises me, because I know the Sears interior has way more square footage. And sure enough, I think a section (or more) of this Walmart isn't open - the East doors (North East corner of Walmart's property at the mall) aren't open - they are papered over, but when I looked inside past some folded paper, it looks like a lot more store in there. 

So I think they haven't gotten the entire store ready yet, and possibly just opened up... half of it? Can this be true? I really don't know what is going on. I just know I expected it to be at least 2x bigger inside than it really is. Would love to hear someone else's opnion on this.

Only the north facing doors, in the western corner of the Walmart section of the mall is open. 

Second, stock is not good. I thought the stock at the Uptown Walmart was bad (they haven't had table salt for almost a month now); but this one is worse. Selection is much smaller and what they do have is already sold out in a lot of cases. 

One example: I do like Walmart's selection of their ""Good Value"" frozen vegetables (and fruits) - a wide range, incl. baby carrots, cauliflower, rice diced, good mixes, yellow beans, etc etc, and things like frozen avocado chunks, etc. Well this Walmart had none of those. No Good Value frozen veg save for the most basic - the mixed vegetable one (peas, corn, carrots and beans). 

Oh, their carts  require a loonie to use. But apparently the staff there will unlock a cart for you if you ask.

There's two checkouts I saw - one on the second floor (to the rooftop entrance, but it was closed when I went this evening) and one on the main floor. Almost every checkout is self-checkouts. They only have TWO full serve checkouts on the main floor, none on the second floor.

Store is two levels, but I thought the Sears was 3 levels, with a basement level? This store doesn't have a basement level. It does have access to the rooftop parking lot at Hillside, though it looks like they close that entrance early.

Store is shiny new and doesn't have a smell. Yet. 

Customers... I dunno why, but saw a lot of sketchy types when I walked up. Like, a lot. Also saw the cops just come out with some guy. I mean it's only been open 2 days and already the shoplifters etc are in operation? It was at 9:30 when I went. 

Lastly, the staff is very friendly and shiny Walmart new. Wait until they're beat down by the system and shit hours, shit pay, and shit non benefits in a few months. 

Well there you go - the new Walmart review you did not need. But I decided to write it anyway to say if you're driving, you're way better off to go to the Uptown one, which is one of the largest in Canada. If this is walking distance for you, or you live in Oaklands and aren't trying to find a broader range of things (like my yellow beans and mini carrots frozen veg mix), this one will probably do you fine. 

I have a feeling this store might double in size very soon. The outside footprint just doesn't match up with the inside. I assume they're using the basement as their storage / delivery space. 

**TL:DR**: 1/4 the size of the Uptown Walmart, almost all self checkout, maybe has 1/3 the items and brands Uptown Walmart stocks, pharmacy on 2nd level, very clean inside, and friendly staff. Bring a loonie for the shopping cart. Parts of the Walmart sign outside already burnt out. They do not have the baby carrots and beans frozen veg mix from Good Value. ;)",Crime ,0,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"How many of you are taking up gardening (for food) this year? Three of our street neighbours have started up... I guess one good thing about all this #stayathome and #COVID19 is that it's getting some people to work a bit on their own food security and reducing their carbon footprint by gardening at home!

On my street, 3 of my neighbours have taken up home gardening. I have a lot of saved seed (( harvest seeds every year) so I've been sharing it around. It's really good to see - on top of having a good hobby in these trying times, they will be eating great food with a very low environmental impact.

What are you hoping to grow this year?

My gardening story:

After living in condos for 14 years prior, when we moved to Victoria over 3 years ago, it was my goal to learn, set up, and run a productive home garden that produced at least 80% of our non-protein food (ie, fruits and veg) for the months of April through October. After a lot of trial and error, we pretty much hit that goal last year with our garden. 

As one example, we produced about [115kg of tomatoes](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1VE1aXnIIl/), (we're still eating our canned tomatoes several times a week). [We grew 48 garlic bulbs](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz1MudHHFyQ/), and still have about 8 left (they can store well). Grew about 60 onions, and they ran out in February. [Grew about 30kg of potatoes](https://www.instagram.com/p/B0zR7ElnKH9/) (mostly in bags too!), and they lasted through Christmas. I grew [pole beans for the first time last year](https://www.instagram.com/p/B07c32knRSM/) and couldn't believe the production rate. Basically, [we produced a lot of our own food last year](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2aNwK3H5zW/)

Also, I've grown lettuce year round, [including hydroponic lettuce in my basement all winter](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5kmql3HLTl/). Plus lots of other stuff (ground cherries! chilean guava! raspberries - gallons of them! Alpine strawberries! Apples! Plums! more!)

All of this was done in [roughly 116 sq.ft. of raised beds](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjXCkcnhe5M/) (two 3'x10' beds, one 4'x10' bed, and one 2'x8' bed), and a couple dozen containers, from 1/2 gallon pots to 7 gallon grow bags, and 20 gallon big containers.

Okay, braggy, but the point is, I set a goal to grow 80% of the non meats / dairy / breads we consume, and we did it with 4 raised beds and a bunch of bags on a property with really challenging sunlight conditions.

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"I don't think it's okay if your eardrums hurt after leaving a restaurant. I'm not sure what it is with Victoria / the GVRD / Pacific Northwest, but as someone who travels to Europe often on business, I am often quite amazed (in a bad way) how absolutely loud it is in most restaurants here (compared to European restaurants), and it doesn't matter if its a super casual place, or these days, an upscale, ""attempt at fine dining"" place.

Tonight was possibly the worst dining experience I've ever had in Victoria. But it's not isolated... just tonight was worse than usual. We dined at a restaurant on Cook Street (an ""upscale"" place, that's as far as I'll go for now), and I it was so obnoxiously loud in there, I had to leave my two dining companions early and walk out to the street. My ears were literally (not figuratively, but literally) ringing by the time I got out - you know that numbness you have in your jaw, and the feeling you have to swallow and gulp to try and get the ringing / pressure out of your ear. That bad. 

Of course, it's related somewhat to poor interior design which seems endemic in this concrete and wood accent (or exposed brick) fetish (es) restaurants seem to have in interior design without any sound baffling. 

But it's more related to the near constant scenario of ""it always starts with one"". One person at one table is extra loud, and everyone at their table has to compensate. Then the next table over compensates. And so on, and so forth. In our case, it was a woman with one of the loudest, most obnoxious laughs I've heard in some time. It just escalated from there. Every person at our table tried to give her the stink eye, it got so bad, and she didn't care. We told our server. They apologised but did nothing. I complained to the manager. Again, apology, but nothing. Each table around her got louder and louder. Then a group of six guys came in and even topped her table for noise. It was just too much. My ears were in pain, and I had to leave.

Of course, **you're the asshole** if you ask them to keep the volume down. Management's the asshole if they request the table be more quiet.

In Europe, my experience is, this just isn't tolerated. There's also a difference in restaurant layouts: large groups are usually relegated to their own room or area away from the main diners, because yes, even in Europe, big dinner parties can get quite loud. But in the main rooms, if a table is being too loud (my observation is it's usually N. American tourists) management asks them to quiet down for the enjoyment of all. I've actually been asked to be a bit more quiet at one restaurant 2 years ago in Bologna (and it was right to ask me that!) Its absolutely common to be in a room where you can hear the low voice of your dinner companion in France, in Italy, in Belgium, in Holland. It's the exception here in Victoria, or Vancouver, or Seattle. 

I'm not that old, but I've noticed this has been getting worse in the past 10-15 years. There's so little consideration for others any longer, and it's visible when you dine out and have to yell at your companions to be heard, or ask the server to speak up when they're reciting the specials and wines available, because the table next to you is aiming at 100 decibels or higher.",Our Place,0,False,60.0
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"I've come to the realisation that sushi is no longer a budget dinner choice, especially in Victoria Never liked sushi before moving to Vancouver a few decades ago. Even as recently as 2010, I avoided it, but then my new partner (now my wife) loved it, and living close to Commercial Drive where there seemed to be 2 sushi places per block. gave it a go and I also fell in love with the culinary style.

That entire time - 2010-2016 - sushi was our budget ""treat"" dinner. We could go out, get a few rolls, some nigiri, some tataki or other hot stuff, and it would usually work out to about $15-$25 per person depending on how fancy we got. Even high end sushi places were rarely above $35 per person. We had sushi about 1.5 times a week (6-7 times a month) because of it's position in our food budget expenses.

Moving to Victoria, I noted pretty much right away (2017) that sushi here was a) more expensive, and b) lower quality. I expected the quality to go down, with the smaller community, less competition and less offerings, and even expected it to be a bit higher than Vancouver for similar reasons.

But COVID turned sushi from being an expensive ""budget"" dinner here in Victoria to just expensive. The last four times we had sushi (four different restaurants) the bill for our take out or dine in was around $40 per person for fairly poor quality sushi, all things considered.

Nigiri, which used to be like $2-$3 a piece, is now $5-$6 a piece. Budget rolls seem to have gotten smaller and are 95% rice, yet increased 25-40% in price. Signature rolls, which used to be $12-$14, are now mostly over $20. Sashimi plates which were $12-$15 for basic tuna or salmon are now well over $20 with smaller pieces. 

Look, I understand prices are going up. But our experience at least is sushi prices have gone up as much as 100% since COVID, esp. once you factor in smaller portions. 

So now, instead of giving sushi places $$ 7 times a month, my wife and I give sushi places $$$ maybe once every two months, if that. 

I love sushi. I'm also tired of Fujiya for sushi -- both how they sell out incredibly early and the quality is just so so -- as pretty much literally the only budget choice in town if you want tuna. Even Fujiya's portions are smaller, albeit with a smaller price bump.

I can afford $40+ per person (before alcohol) for a meal out a couple of times a month. But paying that much for sushi kind of destroys the place sushi had in my life prior: a budget dinner option that was way more healthy than going to McDonalds.","Alcoholic , Community Plan to End Homelessness , Lived Experience, Our Place, People with lived experience, Poor ",0,False,2.941176470588235
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Is any restaurant / food cart / etc in town trying to lower prices / increase volume to overcome these financially tough times? There's [lots of threads in this sub lately about shrinkflation](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/13jnh1m/tacofino_seems_to_have_shrunken_their_burritos/) and prices going through the roof as restaurants, food carts and the like in Victoria lately.

I wonder if any food service business in Victoria and environs has tried the different tact of lowering prices and increasing volume of output, where the profit per item is lower, but they're selling 2, 3, 5x more of said product to overall increase the day's profits?

Anyone know of any?

It can be a good path. Some operating costs are fixed no matter how much you make: rent, utilities, insurance, etc etc. Other food costs increase when you increase production, like staffing costs, equipment wear and tear (minimal), some utilities costs (again minimal), etc. Raw ingredient costs surprisingly can level out or even decrease, especially if there's less spoilage (because more bulk ingredient is used). If you're buying 10 lemons a day, your cost per lemon will be higher than if you're buying 100 lemons a day, as a basic example. (nb, if you're paying the same for a lemon from wholesale regardless if you buy 10 or 100 a day, you need to be a better negotiator, IMO). 

One other example, and please excuse the basic-ness of this. If your rent is $100 per day, and you plan to sell 20 burgers a day, $5 of each of those burgers sold has to go to rent. But if you structure and plan to sell 100 burgers a day, then just $1 per burger has to cover rent. 

The main thing is, is your business going bankrupt because you make 20 of an item per day, price it so if you sell all 20 at an inflated price, it covers your operating cost, yet you only sell 10 per day because not many customers want to pay that inflated price?

If you make 100 of the same items per day, price it so selling 75 of those covers your operating costs for the day, which makes it much lower for the consumer, and you sell 100 a day, you're laughing to the bank. But it is more work.

Our last frost date was technically between March 1 and 10, but I saw frost on the ground in the mornings a few days ago. That's just one example.

So if you're trying to get your spring garden fired up, here's some thoughts and resources.

First, we're super blessed to have some really good local resources for starting and veteran gardeners. One of the first resources you should check out is [Growing Food Together](https://www.growingfood-together.com/), a local website and resource. If you are on a fixed income, they will even [provide you with starter seedlings for a wide variety of plants](https://www.growingfood-together.com/get-growing-victoria) between May 15 and early June, so mark that in your calendars.

Another excellent resource is the [Master Gardeners Victoria](http://mgabc.org/content/victoria) website. Victoria has it's own larger ""micro climate"" setting, encapsulating dozens and dozens of even smaller micro climates, and resources like Master Gardeners Victoria and Growing Food Together both help you with hyper-local growing information.

What you should be doing right now if you want to get your spring garden going:

* clean up and refresh your raised beds. If you haven't already done so, a light tilling and addition of compost to your raised beds is always beneficial to a long growing season this summer. Pick out the weeds, give the top a dressing and move a bit of soil around. Even practitioners of the ""no dig"" gardening style popular in some corners could benefit from a gentle raking of the top layer.

* refresh and turn over your portable growing areas. If you do a lot of grow bag / 10/20gal potter growing like I do, given these are much smaller soil masses, do what I do: dump all that soil onto big tarps, toss in a good amount of compost along with some organic pellet fertilizer, and refill the bags. To expect them to have the same performance last year without a real tilling is is a bit of a pipe dream ;)

* get early spring seeds into the raised beds now. Things like peas, lettuce, broad beans, spinach, arugula, are all set to grow in these conditions, right in the soil without the need to do seedling starts in small pots or seed starters. 

* you can start your root veg now too, outdoors. This means time to start planting your seeds outdoors for turnips, parsnips, carrots and other root veg you want this summer. The next few weeks is when you put your potatoes into the ground.

* start seedling trays for some summer plants. Now is also the time you start your tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, leeks, etc into 6 cell (or larger) indoor seedling trays. Give them slight warmth for their start, and give them a ton of light for the development stage. You should be able to migrate them outdoors for a second stage growth in pots in late April, early May, then do the final transfer of them into the ground mid May.

* Don't start pole beans yet; my experience with starting pole beans inside under lights and with warmth is once they start, they go FAST, so if you start them now, they're going to be stunted and screwed up by the time you want to get them in the ground, around Mid May. Start these in early / mid April.

As for raised beds vs portable growing mediums (grow bags etc), i tend to do early peas in both, with the intent of harvesting them no matter what by mid-late May; they provide really good nutrients and nitrogen to the soil, and I do get some harvest from them. By mid-end May, a lot of my portable growing mediums get their own cherry tomato plants, which do well and thrive because of the combination of a) good tilling at the start of the season, b) inclusion of long-release fertilizer in the soil at season start, and c) the nitrogen and nutrients the pea growth provided.

ADDENDUM: One person messaged me asking about sources for 6mm greenhouse plastic for raised beds, building your own greenhouse, lean tos, etc, to protect against frost and extend your growing season. We have an excellent shop here on the Peninsula that cuts greenhouse plastic to order: https://www.integritysalesanddistributors.ca/ I found them through this sub 6 years ago.


Well, that's a wall of text, but I'll circle around the the two linked websites I provided above: they have an absolute wealth of information for anyone interested in growing food in Victoria. Thanks to resources like those, my wife and I are able to grow about 80% of the non-protein food we consume between April and October, all from a combined 170ish sq.ft of growing space.",Peers Victoria Resources Society ,1,True,0.0

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"My wife and I cannot really afford to dine out in Victoria any longer - the industry has outpriced us. Last night, my wife and I went out to a place in Sidney to meet a few friends and enjoy some promised Scottish music (there wasn't any Scottish music, but that's another story). 

I won't name the place but it is a) self serve (you have to go up and order food and drink from the counter) and b) self cleaning (they don't really bus the tables, but there are cleaning / basket stations around the place to drop off your plates, cutlery and glassware. All they do is bring out your food and drink to the table.

We thought we were going sorta budget, hoping to keep things under $75 for the two of us. Ordered a sandwich, small plate pasta dish, and one app to share. We each had one beer, and I also had a flight of taster beers to try. 

When we went to pay (again requiring us to line up at the counter with a line that moved incredibly slow all night), first, our bill was over $85, AND on the card reader is a minimum 18% tip. The option were 18%, 20%, 22% and 25%. This on a place with zero service except for bringing food or drink out. 

I thought the bill at $85 was too high, so I asked to see the receipt first; the clerk got all flustered and said the were having problems with their terminal, and she couldn't print on out. Eventually we found out she charged us for one beer too many. No apologies, no nothing, adjusted the bill (now $75+ tax) and presented the scanner again with the 18% min tip option.

Honestly, I tipped 8%, and I feel that was too high. 

When a sandwich, a small-plate spaghetti dish, one scotch egg, 2 beers and a beer flight are $75 before tax or tip, and then on top of that they expect you to tip another 20%, post taxes, for almost zero service, IMO this industry is pricing itself to death. 

We decided we cannot afford to dine out any longer. Both for our wallets, and for our sanity in these current conditions. Maybe crazy happy hour dining, at best. Or back to plain fast food for our ""dine out treat"".

A lot of it is Victoria specific too - if you compare the prices charged at the new Block Kitchen and Bar on Yates with the original Block in Banff, you will see the local one's prices on similar dishes are as much as $8 more. And I can tell you, Banff isn't cheap for rent.","Affordable, Our Place",0,False,20.0

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"On Ben Isitt. I know many are happy to see Isitt gone from Council. I have mixed feelings when I chose not to vote for him this time around. 

Isitt's stance on things like charging war veterans for policing costs around Remembrance Day, his shoddy voting on housing issues, and his ""woke"" grandstanding on some issues were things I was particularly upset about. Plus I think socialism bordering on communism is not a political affiliation I want to vote for.

But I'm not a black and white person. I tend to regard people as much, if not more so on their merits as I do on their defaults / defects. 

I have to say Isitt took the administrative part of his job as councillor seriously and performed it well. Others in this sub have said similar things: Isitt was a responsive councillor who often met with local community groups, neighbourhood groups, even just a few folks on one block who had concerns or wants from action by the city on something local. He held hands in the process of getting the city to do things at the neighbourhood level, guiding people through the process.

He was the lead on our own block's intent to get a new and safe pathway done up to Summit Park five years ago; he attended our neighbourhood meeting on it, coached us on what to do before Council, and was one of two councillors who took the lead in sponsoring our proposal, and our request, which passed, was added to the city budget. The work was done the year later. Before that path was built, I know of at least four injuries that happened to people trying to walk up the 100 year old nature path up the hill in just two years (my wife included). Now that the pathway is there, including a stepped portion, it's a lot safer and more convenient to access summit park, a boon esp. during COVID when parks were all we had to get out and get some fresh air.

Because of that, even though I don't agree with his politics, etc. I did vote for him last election, saying to myself I wouldn't vote for him again unless he changes some of his council positions and grandstanding. He didn't, so this time around, he didn't get my vote.

But I am grateful for his administrative work as a councillor, and I hope all the newly elected councillors take the community / administrative side of their jobs just as seriously. Time will tell.",Social Housing ,1,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Once again, the Vancouver Whitecaps are coming to town... Eventful night in Canadian soccer, as the semi finals are set for the Canadian Championships. Earlier last night, the Whitecaps beat the York United CPL team to advance into the semi-finals for the Canadian Championships.

Then later last night (just a few hours ago), Pacific FC, playing at Starlight Stadium, beat Burnaby's TSS Rovers to also advance to the semi finals.

Because of the random draw at the start of the tournament, Pacific FC will host their semi final game, which will be against the Vancouver Whitecaps. If they beat the 'caps, then they will play in the finals, which is also being hosted at Starlight (again, luck of the draw!). 

~~Game time and date isn't set yet, but it's between May 23 and May 25.~~

Beyond loving that we have a FIFA Tier 1 professional soccer team to cheer on here in Victoria (er, Langford), I absolutely love the Canadian Championships, which is not league play, but all pro (and some semi-pro) teams in Canada competing for both a trophy (the Voyageur's Cup), and a place in the CONCACAF's Champions League, where they will play the best teams in all of North and Central America the following year. This match against the Whitecaps is super important, and one of three pathways Pacific FC have to get into the Champions League (the other two being the season winner in the CPL, or the finals championship winner in the CPL).

Another reason to love the beautiful game that soccer is. It's not just you locked in your league. There's potential to play some of the world's best and most famous teams, and some of them right in your own back yard. Hypothetically, Pacific FC could one day play teams like Bayern Munich or Manchester City. Sure, realistically it might be impossible, but still statistically possible (PFC would have to win the Champions League to get into the FIFA World Cup Clubs competition).

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Once more with the Pacific FC - their newest, biggest game ever seen at Starlight coming up Tuesday. Since Pacific FC won their home and home matchup against Jamaica's Waterhouse team in the ScotiaBank Concacaf League (SCL) a few weeks ago they advanced to the round of sixteen, and this time, they are up against a SCL powerhouse, [Costa Rica's CS Herediano](https://ca.soccerway.com/teams/costa-rica/cs-herediano/5047/), who have won the SCL in the past, and have also competed in the Concacaf Champions League.

I would argue this is the toughest team that Pacific FC will ever face in their short lifetime - even tougher than the Vancouver Whitecaps. Herediano is the odds on favourite, but Pacific FC has something they don't: they have some of the best fans in the CPL, and the team draws incredible strength from their fans, often putting out their best performances.

This is another massive moment for Pacific FC. If they go 2-0, 3-1 or similar against Herdiano, they stand a huge chance of winning this round (they still will have to play down in Costa Rica a week later, as it is a home-and-home set of games, with aggregate scoring, and home goals being tie-breakers). 

The game is Tuesday, August 16, at 7pm at Starlight.

And today, the team just emailed out the special code for season ticket holders (I'm one) to offer a friends and family discounted price to attend the game.

The game starts at 4pm, at [Starlight Stadium in Langford](https://www.tourismvictoria.com/starlight-stadium); there's going to be a lot of hoopla before the game though, so good to get there at 3pm or even earlier. Tickets via the link in the previous paragraph.

**Some Background and Notes**

The newest team in the CPL, the Vancouver Football Club, is owned by one of the same owners of the Pacific FC - Rob Friend. Yeah, we're not happy about that as fans. They poached our #1 keeper, and a few other players. Actually based in Langley and playing in a scaffolding pop up stadium.  Their logo is a bit basic, and some Pacific FC fans have taken to calling them the [Langley Penis Birds](https://imgur.com/a/rxO6P9Z) because of the logo design and their location (lol).

Debate is on about what to call this rivalry / matchup. Suggestions: a) the Rob Friend(ly). b) Salish Sea Derby. c) Georgia Straight Derby. d) Lang Derby (or Lang Lang Derby). 

This is a huge year for the Canadian Premier League and the teams that place at the top. **TWO** spots are given to the CPL this year for entry in the 2024 CONCACAF Champions League. They will go to the team that finishes first in league play, and the team that wins the championship playoff.

Also, Pacific FC's draw this year in the Canadian Championship for the Voyageur's Cup is amazing (all home games at Starlight until the final!) and the winner of the CC gets an automatic berth in the CONCACAF Champions League as well, giving the possibility for up to 3 teams from the CPL playing in the CCL next year.  PFC's first Canadian Championship game is coming up very soon. If we win the first two rounds, we'll be hosting Vancouver Whitecaps at Starlight (most likely) in round 3. Anyone remember what happened last time the 'Caps played at Starlight? :)

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Pacific FC and Starlight Stadium in Langford the only stadium in the entire CPL not to have vaccine requirements. **EDIT UPDATE**

At 3pm today, the team has [changed their position and updated to the full Vaccine Card protocols](https://twitter.com/Pacificfccpl/status/1442612794663194631). I am very happy they have done this, and have edited this post to reflect the news.

Original post:

If you know my posting history, I'm a huge fan and supporter of our professional soccer team - to the point where I was accused of being a shill for them in this sub. I've encouraged people to go to the games and discover this great team.

Well, I'm entirely disappointed that they are now the only team in the entire Canadian Premier League to not have announced vaccine requirements for attendance at the games. In fact, they are the **only professional soccer team in Canada not to have vaccine requirements for game attendance** (including MLS teams and Ontario League 1 teams). So I don't advise going any longer until they do. If you are a fan of the team, [contact them](https://pacificfc.canpl.ca/contact) and tell them your thoughts on this subject.

I don't care or want to hear ""well, it's an outdoor ticketed event that isn't covered by the PHO"". I don't give a shit, other than to say Dr. Henry was wrong on that - outdoor ticketed events above a certain number of attendees (like 100) should be under the vaccine card PHO. It's a mistake by her. And every other team in the league (7 of them) have brought in vaccine proof requirements, regardless of their provinces' health orders. Many of them also have mask requirements, which PFC also doesn't have (except in indoor spaces, of which there are none other than the bathrooms).

I'm ashamed of my team not taking the lead on this. And getting pissed off about it. This evening, I read an [absolutely heartbreaking thread from an Edmonton ER doctor](https://twitter.com/drdagly/status/1442332435534913542). We're taking this virus too fucking lax these days. 

Every day we're seeing numbers in the 600-800 range in BC (which is higher than Ontario) for infections, and we're seeing 8, 10+ die some days, and we're all blasé about it now. When we had 250-300 new daily  infections 10 months ago, and 2 or 3 deaths a day, we were caring, paying attention, wearing masks, taking personal steps and sacrifices to get through this. Dr. Henry and Minister Dix were daily bringing attention, and expressing grief to the families.

Now it's just a fucking statistic. Now we're just... ""I'm fed up with wearing a mask"". Or ""Yeah, I'll have my house party this weekend because it's time for me to have some fun"" while more are dying and more are getting sick. While the ICUs are filling up. While doctors, like the Edmonton ER doctor, has to go through that uncomprehensible trauma and grief on a daily basis.

I'm on a rant because I'm absolutely fed up with the unvaccinated dragging this out, prolonging the exposure and spread of this virus. And they'll be flocking to events and venues they know won't be scanning for vaccine proof, including PFC games. Enough is enough. And Pacific FC needs to get on the right page soon, IMO.","BC Housing, Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, Point in Time",0,False,16.129032258064516
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Pacific FC destroys the first international team to visit Starlight, now ready for a tougher foe on August 16. So last night, Pacific FC played their home game against their first International team in the CONCACAF League - Jamaica's Waterhouse team, and they absolutely obliterated the visiting Jamaicans, 6-0. A nearly full house too, and it was one of the best atmospheres I've ever experienced at Starlight Stadium. The entire crowd was completely into the game. They even applauded the Jamaicans at every chance (I remember their keeper made one amazing save, and got a lot of applause for it). 

Well, [winning that game puts Pacific FC into the ""Round of 16""](https://www.concacaf.com/en/concacaf-league/article/diaz-heard-masterful-as-pacific-down-waterhouse/) for CONCACAF League, and our draw is a much, much tougher team: It's Costa Rica's CS Herediano, which is a bit of a powerhouse in CONCACAF. They've won the CL championship in the past, and have competed several times in the higher CONCACAF Champions League.  They won the [CL as recently as 2018](https://www.concacaf.com/en/concacaf-league/article/2018-scotiabank-concacaf-league-herediano-emerge-as-champion/).

Basically, no pushover. At all. One could even argue they will be tougher than the toughest opponent Pacific FC have ever faced so far - the Vancouver Whitecaps.

The next game was just announced: it will be at Starlight Stadium on August 16, the first in the home and home series against CS Herediano. If you're a season ticket holder (I am!) the team today announced something fantastic: they're gifting tickets to all season ticket holders (STH) for this game. Normally as a STH, you get all the regular home games in the club's season, plus one extra ticket for some special game. The game against Waterhouse was the free ticket for this season, so PFC giving free tickets for the Costa Rica matchup is quite generous.

If I get another ""friends and family"" discount link sent my way as a STH, I will share it here for anyone who wants to take advantage.

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Pacific FC in Finals of Canadian Premier League Championship, but will not be hosting (so get ready for watch parties on Dec 5). Today, Hamilton's Forge FC (finished top in the table) beat York FC (finished 4th in the table), so because of their regular season rankings and Pacific FC finishing third in the table, this means that Forge FC will be hosting the Championship game on December 5th (instead of this coming weekend). It will be at 1:30pm PST time (4:30pm Hamilton start time) Reasons: Forge plays in the same stadium as the Hamilton Tiger Cats, and the CFL playoffs take the preferred schedule spot.

**We still have an absolutely fantastic chance to win the finals; we've played well against Forge this year**. Pacific FC winning would bring a national sports championship to Vancouver Island, Langford, and Victoria. It also means that Pacific FC, by winning will be in the CONCACAF League Tournament next year, meaning that some of the top teams from Central America will be making the trip up to Victoria next year to play home and away games at Starlight Stadium.

The team will be having an official watch party for this game, so once they announce it, I'll amend my post to provide the location. I can also tell you various pubs in town, including the Strath and Yates Street Pub have regular sections booked off for Pacific FC games and they'll no doubt be set up for this final.

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Pacific FC is in the hunt to win the Canadian Premier League - Next game this Sat at 3pm In case you aren't aware, our local professional soccer team - Pacific FC (which now require vaccine cards for attending their games woo hoo!) is at the top of the table in the Canadian Premier League (CPL), with three home games to go. Every single game is crucial, and this team absolutely feeds off local support, so I hope Victorians (and Langfordonians, and Saanichtons, and Esquimaltians etc etc) show up.

The next game is **this Saturday, 3pm, against Winnipeg Valour**. Then a game on Oct 26 7pm against Edmonton, and the final regular home season game on Oct 30 against York United. 

I just got my email from the team today, and they have a special 3 pack pricing for the last 3 games, $59 for 3 games ($19.50 a ticket); also the Oct 26 game tickets are $10 each for women and girls sports teams.

(nb, I do not work for, or am associated with the team. I am a season ticket holder, and a strong supporter of our local pro soccer team, that is all).

**A Bit More Background on Why PFC Winning the CPL is Important**

Several things happened this year to make the CPL (Canada's Tier 1 FIFA league) more important and relevant. The most crucial thing is, starting in 2024, TWO CPL teams (probably the top two during the regular season table, but TBA) will make the CONCACAF Champions League. It's also possible for a THIRD CPL team to make the Champions League if a CPL team wins the Canadian Championship. There's some amazing opportunities for Pacific FC to be in the Champions League within 2-3 years.

That's the future. But what about this year? Well right now, if a team wins the Canadian Premier League championship, they get a place in next year's CONCACAF League (not Champions League) in 2022 (and if they win that League, they get in the ChampLeague the next year). Also, if a CPL team wins the Canadian Championships, they also get a berth in the Champions League next year.  

Pacific FC is in the semi finals of the Canadian Championships, playing Toronto FC (in Toronto, boo) in November. If they win that, they go to the finals, TBA. If they win that, they're in the Champions League next year.

Pacific FC is also top of the table right now in the CPL, but have struggled of late. They still have a better than average chance of winning it all. 

**A Bit More on What it Means to Us in the CRD**

What this means to us is this: when a team gets into the CONCACAF Champions League, it means some of the best teams in North and Central America will be playing matches right here on Vancouver Island, at Starlight Stadium against Pacific FC. We could see the Seattle Sounders playing PFC. We could see Chivas Guadalajara, playing at Starlight Stadium. This kind of stuff gets international coverage and is amazingly good for our Island, for tourism, for stature and for growing the sport of soccer. 

I don't know about you, but I would kill to see the Sounders, or Guadalajara, or Club America, or LAFC, or the Galaxy, or TorontoFC playing matches at Starlight stadium. And It would be a joy of a lifetime if PFC beat any of these teams in their home stadium.

**To get there, the team needs fans to show up to the games and fully support the team**. PFC absolutely feeds off their local support, and they show their appreciation fully for it. Hope to see you there at the game this Saturday, 3pm. And bonus - everyone attending will be vaccinated!",WiN,0,False,21.428571428571427
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Pacific FC is lining up for 3 possible trophies / championships this season and looking good. Our local soccer team in Canada's FIFA Tier 1 soccer league, Pacific FC, is in the run for not one, not two, but THREE trophies and championships this year. The main one, Canadian Premier League champion, is currently underway as the team plays its CPL season. But you may not be aware of the other two: the second of which starts next Tuesday with our second round match against York United in the Canadian Championships, vying for the Voyageur's Cup; or the third one, starting in June, when PFC competes in the CONCACAF League Championship (not to be confused with CONCACAF Champions League, mentioned below), which they qualified for by winning the CPL Championship last year.

One of the things I love about soccer the most is it truly is an international sport that breaks loose of the ""chains"" of league play once in a while - not only do clubs play teams within their leagues, but when they do well, they get to play in other ""leagues"" and tournaments, playing against teams they normally would never play against (like how PFC played (and beat) the Whitecaps last year at Starlight stadium). Here's a breakdown of the three opportunities this year.

**[Canadian Premier League Championship](https://canpl.ca/)**

This is the one PFC plays for every year, along with all the other teams in the CPL; it is league play, but unlike the English Premier League, the CPL has a playoff format that sees the top four teams advance to playoff rounds, to determine a league champion. PFC won this championship last year. This year currently, [Pacific FC is at the top of the table](https://canpl.ca/standings), meaning they're currently the best in the league. Their next game in league play is tonight at Starlight Stadium, 7pm, and yes, tickets are still available (you can also buy them at the gate). 

**[Canadian Championships](https://www.canadasoccer.com/events/canadian-championship/)**

Not so long ago, the Canadian Championships and its trophy, the Voyageur's Cup, wasn't much of a worthy prize: 3 teams (the three MLS teams, Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto) competed for it, and for a time, there was no ""after prize"" like entry into higher international play. Things have changed greatly now. Now, every CPL team is in the tournament. There are two Tier 3 FIFA leagues - League 1 Ontario (L1O) and Première ligue de soccer du Québec (PLSQ) who's winners also make the tournament (soon, a third entry, from BC's League 1 will be in as well). And of course, the three MLS teams from Canada are in. All this means the tournament now has 13 teams (14 next year possibly). 

But even better, the ""prize"" for winning the Canadian Championships, beyond the trophy and bragging rights, is entry into the following year CONCACAF Champions League (CCL), which is the North Western Hemisphere's version of Europes' Champions League: win CanChamps and you're competing next year against the top teams from MLS, Mexico's Liga MX, and other national league champions. CCL is growing in prestige and CONCACAF's idea is to make it as rich a prize (as possible) that it can be.

Because PFC won the CPL championship last year, they had a ""bye"" for the first round. They are playing their first game in the CanChamps next Tueday (May 24) against York ([info and tickets here](https://www.ticketmaster.ca/pacific-fc-canadian-championship-quarterfinal-victoria-british-columbia-05-24-2022/event/11005C59AC544AF1))

So TL:DR on CanChamps - Pacific FC's CanChamps run starts Tues, May 24, and if PFC wins it this year, teams like the Seattle Sounders, or New York FC, or LA Galaxy, or Mexico's Cruz Azul could be playing games at Starlight Stadium year.

**[CONCACAF League](https://www.concacaf.com/concacaf-league/) (CL)**

The third championship that Pacific FC is competing in this year is the CL league. This is actually the last year that the CL will be organized and competed in, as CONCACAF has completely changed their international play league championship structure starting in 2023. But this tournament is extremely important to Pacific FC, and also very cool for us locally. The winner and finalist teams get a trip to next year's Champions League (CCL, mentioned above) for 2023, so doing well in this tournament means qualifying for the higher level CCL next year. This is exactly what Hamilton Forge, a CPL team, did last year: they finished near the top of last year's CL, and this year, they're playing in the CCL, competing against clubs like the Sounders, NYFC, Cruz Azul and others.

For us locally, it means at least two local games played against teams from Central America, and if we win, even more games against better and better Central American clubs. There's no USA teams in CL play - Canada has one entry (CPL champion), and the rest are some of the best clubs in countries like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Mexico, Honduras, Panama and even a few Caribbean countries. 

That said, this is the last year for CL. Starting in 2024, the top two teams in CPL get into the Champions League which has been restructured for better full participation by all CONCACAF countries under FIFA. 

**Wrap Up**

So this is where your local, FIFA Tier 1 soccer team, Pacific FC, is this year. Currently top of the table in the CPL, about to play in the CanChamps, and in June, start play in the CONCACAF League tournament. Three trophies/championships up for grabs! Support these guys!

I am a season ticket holder since day one, a member of the team's supporters' group for the first time this year (Lakeside Buoys) and am a big supporter of the beautiful game and feel entirely fortunate we on the Island have a chance to enjoy it at this fantastic level and opportunity for international play).",WiN,0,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Pacific FC will host their first ever international soccer match at Starlight on August 2nd, vs. Jamaica's Waterhouse team, in CONCACAF League play For those of you who are casual soccer fans, and maybe even attended a Pacific FC game out at Langford's Starlight Stadium, next Tuesday is a huge day for our team in the Canada's Premier League, and a game you might want to attend (for as little as $18, see below).

Because Pacific FC (PFC) won the CPL's championship last year, they have a berth in CONCACAF's League championship, in international play. Yesterday, they were in Jamaica, playing the Jamaican champion team Waterhouse in the first of two home-and-home games. They drew a 0-0 tie, playing in pretty iffy conditions (high temperatures, muggy fog(!!!!) and a so so pitch (normally a cricket pitch!). 

Next Tuesday at 7pm, the team is back home playing Waterhouse in the 2nd game. Winning that match advances PFC to the playoff round of CONCACAF League, meaning more international games to come, and the potential to place in the CONCACAF Champions League for next year (which includes teams like the Whitecaps (who just qualified by beating Toronto last night for the Canadian Championship), LA FC, Atlas FC from Liga 1 in Mexico, and other top MLS teams. 

This match on Tuesday, August 2nd is very, very important to PFC. It's probably the third most important match of their history, after last year's final for the CPL championship, and the match against the Vancouver Whitecaps last year in the Canadian championship. It's also showcasing one of the best things about professional soccer: unlike other sports leagues where club teams just play in those leagues and never play any games against other teams from other leagues around the world, soccer does have it's international component. There is a hypothetical chance that Pacific FC could, one day, play teams like Liverpool or Paris St. Germain (the chance is like winning a lottery, but it still exists, if PFC wins CONCACAF Champions League and goes onto the FIFA Club World Cup). 

If you haven't attended a match yet, or have and enjoyed the experience, this is the game for you to consider attending. The team wants a sell out to really drive the players to new heights and to represent well on the International stage. 

As always with my PFC posts, I am not associated with the club. I do not work for them. I am just a season ticket holder since day one and a serious supporter. I want to see more folks support this team in our region, that's my main driving force.

Also, because I am a season ticket holder, I did get a special ""friends and family"" discount code for the August 2nd game. [Here it is](https://offer.fevo.com/pacific-fc-concacaf-league-hvmssh1-77f43f6) if you want to use it. This gives you the option of buying $18 tickets for the supporters / general admission sections.

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Pacific FC's first game is a complete sell out this weekend. Pro sports comes to Vancouver Island. Today Pacific FC, Vancouver Island's entry into the brand new Canadian Soccer League, [announced their first ever game is a complete sell out today on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Pacificfccpl/status/1121531404007776256). This bodes well for the team and good for the new league too. 

I did some back research, and Victoria hasn't had a professional league team in a long, long time. The Salmon Kings were a kind of semi-pro team that were around for a few years (when the Save on Foods arena was built in 2005) but replaced by a junior hockey team a few years later. I couldn't find a record of a true professional, league based team on the island that wasn't a junior team - did one exist?

Well anyway, one does now. I'm a proud supporter, and while I'm not happy to have to travel to Langford for the games, I have to give it up to Stew, he went way, way beyond what Lisa Helps would have done with Royal Park. Stew wanted the team badly, and is basically footing the entire bill for the Westhills upgrade, which is racing to the finish now (there's a [live stream of it on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FNXyryom8)). 

This kind of stuff is really good for Victoria, IMO. (which is why I get pissed at Lisa for not promoting sports more). It gives us huge exposure across the country, and helps drive what is (IIRC) the number one industry outside of government in the CRD - tourism. There's a television deal in place, plus a media partner with big bucks, and it's sure to showcase our great island quite a bit.

Also, for those who don't know, PFC have possibly the best lineup in the league and are early picks to win everything. Marcus Haber is a solid forward / striker, and though he was injured in preseason, Marcel de Jong is the best signing in the league, coming over from the Whitecaps. Today they announced signing Emile Legault, who's regarded as one of the best under-20 defensive players in Canada right now. This team is keyed up to win.

While the Sunday game is sold out, their next game is the following Wednesday, against Hamilton Forge, and I think tix are still available. I'm a season ticket holder, and a huge, huge soccer fan (was a Whitecaps season ticket holder for five years), and I'm so excited for pro soccer on the Island!",WiN,0,False,1.3513513513513513
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Place in town to repair a 1900s door mortise (knob and lock), or... where to get a tiny metal leaf spring? https://imgur.com/a/4j70VpA

Hey all. see photo. I need to repair one of the door mortises in our 1912 house; the metal leaf spring that moves the door catchsnapped in two places. I crazy clued the two parts I could find (it may work, who knows) but ideally I'd like to get a new leaf spring.

I am NOT MECHANICALLY INCLINED lol. Failing the super glue, any suggestions one where I could get a new bit o' metal leaf spring to replace, or bring the whole lock into a place to get fixed? I'm even trying to think out of the box, and think where a similar piece of stiff, but springy metal could be found, bent with pliers to match the shape of the original, and repurposed. Any ideas?

Optionally, is there any places in town that refurbish these mortises and even make new skeleton keys for them? 

Edit - if there are those of you out there who work with metal and creating a new small leaf spring would be a trivial thing, I'd be happy to trade a bag or two of quality coffee for the effort. ",Tiny Town,0,False,8.333333333333332
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Poor Shelbourne St and its residents. First, yes I know [there are other threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/xm2915/shelbourne/) on the [great Shelbourne Tree Culling](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/xo4494/why_were_all_the_trees_on_shelbourne_street_cut/) but this is the first time I've driven north on the road, past Dairy, and saw first hand the complete culling of a lot of large and majestic trees for bike lanes. 

I thought at first it was just 12 large trees per side, based on what someone said in a previous thread on this subject. Nope, it's pretty much every tree on either side for at least 10 blocks or more (I lost count). Some of the trees, based on the stumps left behind, look to have trunks that were more than 3 feet in diameter. Previously, driving down Shelbourne was like going through a slight canopy of trees, at least in the right lanes on each side; now it's completely barren, with... nothing between the trees and all the houses. They even cut down hedges and other noise and privacy vegetation. 

My main thought is, if I lived on Shelbourne, or within a block of it parallel, I'd be extremely upset with this because of the loss of privacy and the noise absorbing nature of the trees being lost. It's got to also be affecting those who live up to a few blocks away.

Second thought is, this street was one of more nicely tree lined major roads in the Victoria area. Now it's just a barren strip north of Dairy Rd., looking seriously ugly. 

Third thought is, if I were a property owner in that area, I think my property value took a big hit based on what the city did.

I imagine this work is going to influence a lot of votes in Saanich against city councillors and the mayor who approved this massive culling.","BC Housing, Poor ",1,False,22.22222222222222
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Speaking of cheap chicken... Thrifty's $1 chicken quarters are back on (some tips inside) Hey, [remember this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/drdda1/cheapest_bulk_chicken_wings/) from a few months ago, and other discussions on where to buy the cheapest chicken wings, thighs, or legs? 

Well, Thrifties has their chicken quarters (they call them legs with back attached) on for $1 per quarter right now during the dollar day sale. To give you an idea on the cost per kilo - I just bought up 30 of them, and the average weight per quarter is 400g. My math is terrible, but it looks to work out to about $3 per kilogram. You won't find chicken (especially fresh chicken) cheaper on the island.

So here's what you do -- or at least what we do when this sale goes on -- especially if you own dogs (or cats for that matter). Buy as many of these things as you can carry, bring them home and do a simple processing on them - hold the leg up so the thigh and drumstick form a V, slice through the v half way, then split the drumstick from the thigh. Cut the rest of the way through. [Here's a basic video showing the process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcwWcyPMet0). 

Then if you want to get fancy, put all the thighs on some parchment paper on a cookie sheet, slip into your freezer, and individually freeze the thighs. Makes getting to them later easier. Do the same for the drumsticks. If you don't care, just clump 2 thighs in a small ziplock bag, and freeze as portions. Ditto for drumsticks.

Whenever Thriftys puts the quarters on at $1 each, I usually end up buying up to 40 or so, and process them and then put them into our small deep freezer (if you just have a regular fridge, 20 won't take up much room once processed).

In our house, the thighs are for our meals (smart gourmands know the thigh is the most flavourful part of chicken, by a long stretch!), and the drumsticks are for our two dogs to have a simple stock (for mixing with their dry kibble), and drumstick meat. Since these drumsticks basically cost $0.25 each (allowing that the chicken thighs are $0.75 each), it's probably the cheapest actual meat you can buy for your dogs, and way, way better than any store bought canned stuff (or the crazy expensive frozen ""raw"" food for dogs). You also know what goes into your dog's food, because you're cooking and prepping it all. 

Because dogs can't eat allium family items (onions, leeks, garlic etc) which are usually found in most stocks, we make a specific chicken stock just for their meals in bulk, and do it this way:

* Arrange 6 drumsticks inside a medium wide pot with a lid. Add some chopped carrots and chopped celery and fill with water until the water is well above the drumsticks.
* Cook on medium low (a nice simmer) for about 2 hours or more. Basically until all the chicken meat is falling off the bone.
* Top up water a bit during cooking to maintain a volume above the drumsticks
* Pour all the broth through a sieve, let cool.
* pull all the meat you can off the bones (incl. skin); chop and dice, freeze half of it, keep other half in the fridge for your dogs' main meal.
* the broth can easily freeze - we usually freeze half, and keep half in a mason jar in the fridge. You should end up with at least 1.5-2l of broth.
* we have small dogs (22lb and 15lb), so for each dinner, they get 3-4 tbsp of a quality kibble, a tbsp of broth, and a tbsp or two of the diced chicken meat. Sometimes we heat it up, sometimes we don't.

I think the $1 per chicken quarter sale Thrifty's has several times a year is my favourite Thrifty's sale... well that, and when they do entire wheels of gouda cheese for under $1.20/100g. We basically get 3 months' worth of chicken for ourselves, and for our dogs main meals, for less than $40.",BC Housing,0,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Stew, you did this to yourself, really buddy. Look, I like Stew. I like that he got things done in Langford. I don't live in Langford, but as a life-long Pacific FC season ticket holder, I know this team, nor the stadium, would exist on Vancouver Island without Stew, so I'll always be grateful to him for that. 

I don't agree with everything Stew did in Langford. I do think he needed better greenspace management in the city to go along with his development plans. I have a friend who, when they bought their home in Langford (on land that was cleared of forest), he had a forest right behind his back yard, which was a big reason he bought the house. A few years later, and Stew and Crew allowed new developer buddies to raze that forrest behind Craig's house for even more SFH development. Craig's pissed about that, and I can see why, but Craig himself lives and owns land that used to be a lush forrest.

I think the lack of care about greenspace and preserving some nature is part of why Stew was kicked out, but I think a bigger deal is Stew took his re-election for granted, and tried to pull a 'I'll take my ball and go home' with voters if they didn't also vote in his slate. 

I've met Stew many times now (mostly PFC events). He's charismatic, but also very much an ""old boys' club"" guy who swears a fucking storm, hangs out with his fellow good old boys and trades war stories with whiskeys OR Budweisers in hand. Though I've never heard it myself, I could totally picture Stew and Crew sitting around bragging about past conquests - he's that kind of guy. Stew's a relic of 1980s politicians, where he probably learned his craft before getting first elected as mayor of the newly incorporated Langford in (I think) 1992.

Stew's also a ""family this, family that, families families families, family values"" guy in his public persona, but he also reminds me of those crap white ""christian"" baptist types - complete hypocrites on things that are really important these days: equal rights, women's rights, lgbtq rights, the environment, climate change, and more. Just listen how he talked about Lillian Szapk this evening; that's the real Stew on other people.

They made it clear in the news report that this is still not the case in BC. And it's so bad here that even those with presumptive cases (they interviewed one on air) still don't get tested.

I'm sorry, but this is absolute bullshit. We need to get to a place in this province, on this island, in this city, where if you want a test, you can get a test.

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"The Process of Getting the Latest Booster Shot for COVID This fall, the BC Govt is organizing the new super booster shots for COVID and the Omicron variants, and while many of you may have already had your booster shot, I just wanted to share what the experience was like for those of you who have not gotten the shot yet, or are on the fence.

Basically: the experience is like a well oiled machine.

BC Health has this all down to a nice science now. First, you get a notification via text (or in some cases, email) that you are eligible and can book an appointment.

Directs you to the get vaccinated BC govt site. There, you get to pick a) the type of vaccine you want (there's choices, including the latest super shot) b) the location you want (there's plenty, including pharmacy locations, but also govt-organized locations, which I picked), c) date and time with lots of options available via a click.

I chose the super shot and picked the location off Quadra (on Kings Road) at that former school that BC Health has used in the past for other vaccination runs. 

The day of, I get there 4 minutes before my scheduled appointment. Head in, no lineup at all. They do request people wear a mask inside (not required, but they offer free masks and ask politely). I had one with me so put it on.

Get to registration room, first in line, they have me set up with my little printout, I go to the room with the black arrow. Get in there, immediately directed to a seat, no waiting. Pleasant chat with the retired nurse who administered my shot, asking me the usual questions about reactions, etc. 

I get my shot literally 1 minute after my appointment time. 

Directed to the wait 15 minutes room. There's about 20 people in there, seating still spread out. One change - they now say ""wait 10 to 15 minutes"" for any possible reactions.

Did my 10 mins, and left.

30 minutes later, I get a text, saying my shot is registered and complete, here's a PDF to download about possible reactions and what to expect the next few days.

All in all, very seamless, very organized, everyone super polite and helpful, no long waits, no stress. I had a sore arm (around where the shot was) for a day and that's it.

As a side note, my wife booked hers through a pharmacy, and when she got there, they were out of the super shot, and offered her some old Moderna. She didn't want that (wanted the omicron super mix), so she refused and asked them to reschedule. They could not on site, and were supposed to do something to indicate her appointment was cancelled so she could reschedule on the BC Health website. Shoppers Drug Mart apparently **did not do this though** so for several days after, she could not re-book thru the website. She had to call the 1-800 number, and after a few tries (voice mail several times), she was finally able to reschedule. Based on my experience, she chose to reschedule and go to a BC Govt Health Care location instead of a pharmacy.

b) they can't hire enough workers to actually work the store.

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Victoria needs a solution to the rat problem. After the ""good stuff"" (all relative) rat poison was banned a few years ago in BC, the rat population has absolutely exploded, at least around my neighbourhood. All my neighbours, especially those who maintain food gardens, are noticing the impact. There's at least six or eight just around our own house, and they're so brazen now, they'll literally sit there munching away on your tomatoes or raspberries while you approach them, only skirting off when you get within a few feet. We've had them access our house as well through means we still haven't figured out.

I understand the reasoning for the poison ban (owls, birds of prey, cats, secondary injuries and death) but when a government bans something that kept a vermin species in check, they really should be bringing in another solution to replace it. 

Anyways, just ranting (I'm going to be in contact with the mayor and counsellors about this issue, so yeah, I will do something besides online ranting), because I found the first of my ripening tomatoes today all bitten into and munched up, after I spent months taking care of the plants and trying to promote their growth and production.",BC Housing,1,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"We need better fruit and veg store options in Victoria (a rant) One thing I very much miss since moving from Vancouver years ago is the absolute lack of Mom and Pop fruit and veg stores in Victoria. There are a few here and there (Chinatown... er... is that it?) but there's nothing like Donalds or the neighbourhood fruit and veg stores peppered all through Vancouver.

In Victoria, the ""go to"" that we have to settle with is... Root Cellar. Which IMO, has gotten worse and worse produce over the past few years, but higher and higher prices. Was in today, and the lettuce section was completely pathetic, and root veg was in the $5/lb price (!!!!) $5 a lb for parsnips!!!! WTF.  

I really want to shop local for fruit and veg, don't want to go to Walmart etc, but honestly, my food budget is dictating that's exactly what I should be doing. Lemons and limes there, you can usually get 8-10 in a bag for $4 or $5; 3 or 4 at Root Cellar for the same price. Parsnips and turnips in the $1.50-$2/lb range. Potatoes usually under $1.50 a lb for you pick. 

Anyway, this is more of a rant than anything else. Root Cellar has no real competition, and as such can charge crazy high prices for substandard produce. I wish they did have some competition.

VictoriaBC,ilikeycoffee,"Why we have a shortage of GP Medical Doctors (Family Doctors) in BC and esp. in Victoria... I posted this to the other thread about the docs leaving their practice, but wanted to start a new thread as well. NB, you can look up any Doctor's MSP billings because they are public knowledge. You can also look up MSP billing rates to see what doctors can charge for your health care needs.

My wife, who used to be the office manager for a Vancouver specialist doctor, did the math on our own Victoria GP Family Doctor we feel very privileged to have, and what he takes home each year.

He works his ass off, has an absolutely packed list of clientele (patients), has a nurse taking a lot of work as well... and according to public records, his office made $293K in MSP billings last year. His expenses on that (these are all estimates, but my wife has experience with these things so the numbers come from her)

* $60K yearly office rent and office management costs (we're estimating that, and it might be more)
* $55K salary + govt fees (cpp, etc) for 1 office manager / receptionist (this is a low estimate)
* $85K salary for nurse (again, low balling here)
* $10K for incidentals

That means the doc's gross take home (pre income tax) is $83K from MSP billings. Less than what the nurse is probably paid. There are some other non MSP billings the GP can make, incl. fees for legal documents etc, but that's probably only another $10K gross a year.

This means our GP's gross take home pay is estimated around $93K a year.

That's absolutely ridiculous. I don't think doctors should make $500K or $1mil a year, but under $100K? I know plumbers who make that much or more.

The most common visit that doctors can bill for is at the $37.50 rate. That's for a typical ~~20-25 minute~~ (10-15 minute) visit. Want your prescription refilled? That's $32. Even a full annual physical is billed at $75ish. If you ever wonder why doctors are rushing you out, it's because they make jack shit per hour under MSP billing and need volume.

They also have to buy all the equipment you see in their offices. The govt isn't handing out expensive gear to family doctors - they buy all that stuff themselves. If you are a family doctor in BC, you are a business person, operating a small business with no handouts or equipment provided by the government. 

If GPs in BC could make around $150-$200K a year after office expenses and the salaries of jobs they pay themselves (like office technicians, managers, nurses), I think we'd have a lot more GPs to sign up with.

**This is the real and only reason why it's nearly impossible to get a general practitioner Medical Doctor in British Columbia, and especially high expenses areas like Victoria and Vancouver. It's up to us to convince the government to properly pay doctors and revise the MSP payments system**

Personally, I think the MSP system can stay ""as is"", but MDs should also be paid a base salary - say $50K, then all the MSP billing makes u the rest of their income and office expenses.","Low income, Low-income, Victoria Women in Need",1,True,0.0

I had Victoria Drains come and do a camera scoping of my perimeter drains in August. I was shocked at the fact that you essentially have to pay like $300 just to get a quote. Seems like the only industry that can get away with this especially when it seems they will just tell you that you need to replace all your perimeter drains if your house is old anyways. They also tried to tell me they couldn't proceed with any work until April/May after the rainy season, when I got the inspection done in August!

Anyways, the inspection found that my gutters pour down into the storm lateral on the back of the house and are not connected to the perimeter drains. I was told this is good as it is flushing rainwater away from my house rather than into the old concrete tiles around the house.

So I actually just had them do a clean out of the sewer drain that goes out to the front yard towards the city lateral and the storm drain that goes out the backyard connecting to a another city lateral. 

I was surprised when they advised to wait to have the original drain tiles around the house inspected until I could afford to replace them all. There thinking was that I would just have to pay for hours of digging five feet under ground and that they would find the original drain tiles need to be replaced anyways. I was advised to just wait until I could afford the $20-30k to have the original concrete tiles around the house replaced. 

Anyways, I have a lot of decking around my house, so it will be quite the process to have everything replaced. I or they will probably have to rip up all the decking and it will be a major job, hence the hefty price tag.

My question is really around if I just need to bite the bullet and get everything replaced or if this is just fear mongering and my drains will last longer? 

I also didn't have any flooding in my finished basement during the crazy floods in November nor did I hear about any of my neighbors having any issues. There are other renovations I want to do that are costly and I don't know if my drains really do need to be done ASAP.

Blake and Marla Handley didn’t know whether to be grateful or irritated when they found their car window broken open to relieve the heat stress for their “dog,” lying unresponsive in the back seat.

They could be grateful because as honoured supporters of the SPCA, the Handleys have to appreciate the motive.
article continues below

But they could be irritated because the rescued dog is a stuffed toy and they are looking at a $200 bill to fix the window.

“It was such a sweet gesture but it was done for the wrong reason,” Blake said.

It happened on Wednesday when the couple attended a special luncheon at the Ocean Point Resort laid on by the SPCA in honour of long-time donors. Marla has supported the animal-protection organization for decades.

Blake was feeling pleased with himself that day because he had found a spot to park on the street.

But after lunch as they returned to their 2000 Honda Civic, the Handleys were approached by a couple who asked if they had seen their car and its broken window.

The couple then confessed.

The Handleys never learned their names, but the story they told had them noticing the car in the hot sun with the dog in the rear seat.

They knocked on the windows trying to rouse it. They jostled the vehicle to set off the car alarm. Finally, they telephoned police, who told them to go ahead and break a window.

“Poor fellow even cut his hand when he did it,” Blake said.

The first thought occurring to the Handleys was that “Rory,” the name they gave the toy, had been stolen.

The toy was picked up at Value Village about 20 years ago after the death of the living Rory, their beloved family pet, a bearded collie that died at age 14.

The couple always travel with the toy Rory, across Canada and the U.S. He is a talisman for a family that really loves bearded collies.

The Handleys now have two live ones, MacPherson and his litter sister Precious.

But unlike the toy Rory the real dogs ride only in the couple’s pickup under a canopy, never in the car.

The couple have vivid memories of the time the living Rory found a dead porpoise on the beach at Dallas Road and took full opportunity to roll in the carcass. On the drive home, Rory acted pleased with himself, but Blake said the smell forced their heads out the windows.

As for the toy Rory, Blake said the couple who broke the window are not the first to be fooled. Crossing the border has often prompted government agents to ask after the breed.

“I always go: ‘It’s the kind with the price tag in his ear,’ ” Blake said.

https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/prince-harry-meghan-have-left-canada-for-l-a-reports-1.24107171

>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have left Vancouver Island amid fears of a countrywide lockdown and have reportedly set up permanent residence in the tony Los Angeles neighbourhood of Bel-Air.

>The Sun tabloid has reported that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex boarded a private flight to Los Angeles after vacating their temporary waterfront residence on Vancouver Island. The exact date of their departure is unknown, but the understanding is that they were relocating to avoid a shutdown of the Canada-U.S. border.

>The Sussexes are living in lockdown in Los Angeles, according to The Sun, with their ten-month-old son, Archie.

>“Harry and Meghan have left Canada now for good,” a royal insider was quoted as saying in The Sun. “The borders were closing and flights were stopping. They had to get out.”

>The decision to leave Canada has been dubbed Megxit 2 by newspaper. Megxit refers to the couple’s original decision in January to step back from their roles as senior members of the British Royal Family.

>The Daily Mail had previously reported that Prince Harry felt “helpless” amid the outbreak, with the majority of his family based in England. His father, Prince Charles, 71, tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, and the expectation was that Prince Harry would return home to offer his support.

>He was with Prince Charles on March 9 at the annual Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey in England. The event was the Sussexes’ last outing in a royal capacity before they officially step down from their roles with the Royal Family on March 31.

>The move to California brings the couple closer to Markle’s family and increases her career opportunities. Disney released a trailer Wednesday for its upcoming documentary on elephants, for which Markle provided the voiceover.

>The couple has long wanted to be based in the Los Angeles area, a royal insider told The Sun.

>“They have a big support network there. It’s where their new team of Hollywood agents and PRs and business managers are based. Meghan has lots of friends there and, of course, her mum Doria [Ragland].”

VictoriaBC,jiggybeanz,"How do the most vulnerable people feel right now about COVID? So we're almost 9 months into our new world, and there's no end in sight. We are at risk of further lockdown and economical crises. Psychological conditions will undoubtedly reach unprecedented levels by February. It may be an unpopular thing to say, but I would be shocked if suicide rates don't reach an all time high within the next few months - things are unprecedented right now to say the least. I would be surprised if this wasn't our world for the next 5 years at a minimum, but the fear of viral transmission/interacting with others in large groups will be here for the rest of our lives (I'm open to justifying this in further detail in the comment section if anyone is overly optimistic about all this). Get ready folks, be thankful that you were able to go to clubs/bars, sporting events, concerts, and travel internationally at some point in your lives because this won't be possible the way it was ever again. 

Before I get to my main point, I wanted to summarize the purposes of all this madness (lockdowns, quarantines, masks, distancing, etc). Let's call this argument A: 

\- Reducing the spread of COVID helps reduce the risk of transmission to the elderly population, who are the most vulnerable to short/long term complications and death due to the virus.   
\- Limiting an increase in transmission, and positive cases, helps decrease the burden on our health care system and their capacity to offer intensive care to patients who require this due to COVID. 

Now let's look at the consequences of the measures we are currently taking (we'll call this argument B): 

\- Lost jobs, and extreme financial difficulties for many people   
\- An absolutely absurd level of government emergency respond benefits for our population. How in the world are we going to pay back such massive debts?? Taxes are going to skyrocket eventually   
\- Psychological consequences. People not being able to spend quality time with friends/family, travel, live life to the fullest, etc etc. will lead to a huge mental health crisis, not to mention a longer term effect of people legitimately being afraid of disease transmission and interacting with other people for the rest of their lives 

It's difficult to say that the pros of all the measures we're taking actually outweigh the cons here, and I know that I'm being insensitive when I say that when we look back at this 10-20 years from now, we will confidently be able to say that the economical and psychological consequences of COVID (argument B) will far, FAR outweigh the health implications of the disease itself (argument A).

However, the main premise of my post here today is that there's one thing that's lost in all of this, and that's what the opinion/thoughts are of the people we are actually trying to protect with the measures we're taking. The elderly people in long term care facilities. Our aging parents who are empty nesting when their kids have moved out. Seniors in retirement homes that still have some degree of independence, but know their best years are behind them, and worst years are ahead of them. How do these people feel about being locked in these facilities? Not being able to see loved ones for Christmas? Etc etc. 

In summary, I feel like younger people (the non-vulnerable population), essentially those who can look at themselves and say that they are not at risk for hospitalization/death from COVID, are thinking that we are ""doing our part"" by isolating the elderly, limiting interaction with our aging parents, and being OK with the life we're living right now because it's the right thing to do. But I actually see all of this as somewhat of a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" because we actually don't think about what the people we're trying to protect actually feel about these measures. If I was living in a long term care facility and I wasn't able to see my family/friends, I'd be jumping out the closest window - what's the point of living if all we're doing is being afraid of dying?","Healthcare , Point in Time, Reaching Home ",1,False,0.0

Note: Hope it's okay to post this TC article, I couldn't find another source. Also, the original article title is not very descriptive - I don't think mine is misleading or inaccurate.

There have been a lot of threads about the housing market - here's one about an issue that I found kind of infuriating, as it shows how council is actively obstructing one of the few practical solutions that could mitigate the problem.

Given the problems with housing supply in Victoria, I've always thought that it was crazy how huge the yards of so many houses are. Many are big enough to easily fit 2 or 3 houses, which is what they do in places like Japan or many European cities. 

So why don't more people divide up lots and build more houses? I thought it was because it wasn't economically feasible (although with prices now I'm pretty sure it would be), but apparently the actual reason is red tape.

The linked article is about a large lot that a developer wants to subdivide into 3 small lots - building 3 houses where there was only one. 

Apparently, city council is against this because the houses that would be built would be new and therefore too expensive.

'“There isn’t an acute housing need in our community for houses that are going to be priced where these three new homes will be,” said Coun. Ben Isitt, who was against sending the proposal to public hearing.
(...)
“We need new housing at the lower end of the spectrum, not higher up,” he said.'

I don't see how more housing can be created without the houses being 'new'? I guess tents are the way to achieve that?

In the article, council members also talk about the ""threat"" of redevelopment, and how the two immediate neighbours are in opposition. As usual, they side with a couple complainers rather than the interests of the city as a whole (speed limit reductions on Bay St. are another example of this).

They also say: ""it is reasonable for neighbours to expect a form of development consistent with “what’s been in the neighbourhood for 100 years""'. As for Helps, she is concerned with the ""housing ecosystem"".

Is it just me, or it this insane and stupid? Is having smaller lots really such a devastating thing for a community?

It seems obvious that building more houses on smaller lots would increase supply, pulling down prices for everyone. I guess the council is too extreme left to believe in basic supply and demand?",Community Plan to End Homelessness ,1,True,0.0

VictoriaBC,katewhytephoto,"A local mystery **There’s a tombstone in my parents’ garden. My grandfather passed it down to my dad about 20 years ago, but it didn’t belong to him. In fact, it doesn’t belong to anyone in my family. It belongs to a woman named Isabella Stockand and we think it’s about time that Isabella went home.**

https://preview.redd.it/9jg7u30mo0g71.jpg?width=2889&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1df4c9407a0e978d8468b6289f41da247db793ae

In the 70s, a friend of my grandmother’s bought a house on The Gorge in Victoria, BC. The place was overgrown and in need of some repair. The garden’s stepping stones and steps were paved with slabs of marble that looked just a little too uniform to be typical paving stones and, out of curiosity, and with the help of my grandfather, they flipped a couple of them over to have a look. On the backs were inscriptions: dates, names, places of birth. It was clear that these were tombstones. I can’t imagine buying a house and finding out it was paved with tombstones! The owner offered one to my grandfather as a keepsake - he’d always been pretty fascinated with history and I can imagine him finding the whole thing really interesting. Maybe he hoped to be able to find out more about it - my dad told me that they contacted the Victoria Cemetery Society at one point and an article was written in The Daily Colonist Islander section of the newspaper, but no more came of it and in the days before the internet, it was difficult to do much research. Even 20 years ago, my dad, who is no stranger to historical research - having written two books that required him to spend months sifting through city archives - could find very minimal information about her. We knew that her name was Isabella Stockand. She was from Scotland and died at the age of 44 on August 28, 1867. He also found evidence that she had been a homeowner which was a little rare for a woman of that era, but that was about it. And so her stone remained - in the garden, leaned up against a rock with tendrils of clematis curling around it for two decades. I can think of worse places for a stone to be placed, but something about it has never sat right with me and for some reason I decided to start my own research the other night. After some time on Google, I stumbled across my first major break! I found a 2015 article from the Vancouver Sun where a man named Rob Dixon claimed to be her great-great grandson and he knew that her headstone had been used as a paver and it had always really bothered him. He said that he lived in Manitoba now but if he were still on the west coast, he would try to find it and reunite it with her husband’s grave in Ross Bay cemetery. Through this article, we also found out more information about her - that her husband’s name was James, that she had daughters, one of which had been born at sea while arriving on the ship, the Norman Morrison (for which there is a plaque in the Inner Harbour), in 1851 and that they were one of the first families to settle in Fort Victoria. I tried to track down Mr. Dixon but sadly he passed away a couple of years ago.

After finding this article, my dad found another archival report that explained why the headstones had been moved in the first place.

Isabella passed away in 1867 and was buried in what is known now as Pioneer Square on Quadra Street. By the late 1860s, this graveyard was reaching capacity, had serious drainage problems and was falling into disrepair. It was, at times, near impossible to reach the cemetery and funeral procession were often bogged down in mire. A new cemetery was developed on the waterfront at Ross Bay in 1873 that would fit the needs of Victoria’s growing population. Unfortunately the Quadra Street Cemetery fell into further neglect and became an eyesore and an embarrassment to the community. It took until 1908 before work began cleaning up the old cemetery. The headstones were consolidated to the eastern side of the property and the rest turned into a grassy park and renamed Pioneer Square. Only the most prominent and legible headstones remained and the rest were put into storage.

I was telling my friend Helen about this rabbit hole I’ve been down for the past week and she used her super sleuthing skills to find some more information. Thanks to her, we were able to locate Isabella’s husband’s plot in Ross Bay and find out that she had 8 children. We found an entire website dedicated to descendants of Orkney Island settlers (of which she was one) and I was able to contact a great-great-great granddaughter. She wrote me the loveliest email and told me a little about Amelia - Isabella’s second daughter and the one who was born at sea: “She married at 16 in Victoria to a Scotsman David Ross around the time her mother died by the looks of it, and returned to Scotland where her husband died. She then lived with her mother-in-law in Glamis, which was a small village in Angus, and was a midwife I believe, including for the residents of Glamis castle.  Her children used to play there. That was where the queen mother was brought up.”

So that is where I am at. Our family would love to honour Rob Dixon’s wishes and return Isabella’s headstone to its place by her husband in Ross Bay.

VictoriaBC,kattann,"Has anyone travelled to Seattle via clipper ferry recently? Hello Victoria, 

I’m thinking of taking a trip to Seattle thanksgiving weekend.  I haven’t left the island since covid began.  I’m feeling a bit hesitant about returning to international travel and would feel reassured if I could hear about others’ experiences with taking this trip. 

I’ve tried to do some research regarding entering USA and returning to Canada, via water crossing, in regards to Covid protocol.

My understanding from what I could gather is that I need only proof of vaccination to enter the USA, and that I will need to download ArriveCan in order to return to Canada.  

Could someone who’s done this trip recently let me know if this is correct?  

Additional questions:

Will my small paper vaccine card be accepted as proof of vaccination? (It seems very non secure and non official, but I wasn’t given anything else to prove vaccination.) Or will my QR code that I used for proof of vaccination in Victoria work at the USA border?

I have received my first two shots, but no boosters, for the purposes of travel to the USA, is this considered “fully vaccinated?”

Are there any restrictions in place in Seattle currently?  And if so is a Canadian QR code sufficient as vaccine proof?

VictoriaBC,katto,"Moving to Victoria with a child and a disabled spouse Hello! We currently live in Quebec City. Although gorgeous and loving it here, the winters are a killer for my husband who is in a wheelchair and practically becomes a prisoner in the house for several months out of the year. Our solution: move to Vancouver Island! The climate will be much friendlier to him. We are sooo done with winters.

Anyway, we were looking around the Saanich area. I know that housing and rent is steep in Victoria, but we'll figure it out. Plus, our jobs allow us to work remotely from anywhere, so job hunting isn't a problem. Our time-frame is to get to the island at the end of summer, in time for school to start. We'll be going over on a recon mission during the spring and try to check out neighbourhoods and schools. But we don't want to make a life decision based on a week-long recon, so we'll be renting something at first, get to know the island and area, then hopefully purchase a house.

I have several questions that have been somewhat answered, but not quite, some not, even after browsing this subreddit and other sites. 

1. I know Saanich is a big area. Are there spots to avoid? Why?

2. Accessibility. How wheelchair friendly is Victoria? I have the impression that it is pretty progressive in that regard, but I might be wrong. 

3.  I'm worried about being too late to be able to enrol our son in private schools or into a good school. Are there huge waiting lists for schools? How is the public school system? Will my child be bullied or harassed for coming from a different background (i.e. French, although he's bilingual)? The last question is more of a worry than a question, but I put it there anyway.

4. I know BC is renown for healthy eating, but is it easy to have access to hormone-free, antibiotic-free (pretty much crap free) meat on the island?

5. Medical. I heard that it was really hard to get a family physician. Since we both have something chronic, that's a concern.. are there places where they might take us as a patients?

6. We might end up having to rent downtown if we don't find anything accessible in Saanich until we're ready to buy. How's the drive/traffic from downtown to Saanich and back? Generally, how's the traffic north?

7. What should we know about earthquake preparedness? There's a lot of info out there, but what is really essential to know?

8. We looked at a lot of houses online and I noticed that almost none of them have pools. Here in Quebec, almost every other house, no matter how small, has at least an above-ground pool. Why no pools? Why??!
 
I might think of something else, but that's it for now. Thanks for any feedback!

The long shot was fun, but ultimately, I just had to ask around to a few people who might have had his contact info. Bob is doing well!

&#x200B;

In 2017, I spend a year down in a small seaside town called Torquay, which is a couple hours southwest of Melbourne in Victoria Australia. I stayed for a couple months at the Bells Beach Backpackers and met several good friends, most of us drawn to the area for the excellent waves the area is known for.

&#x200B;

One of the guests of the backpackers at the time was a lovely old chap named Bob from Victoria, Canada. What were the chances! I believe he was in his early 70s, so now he'd be mid to late 70s. It was fun to chat with Bob about life back at home while abroad, particularly during the election that we were missing. After a couple weeks of staying in a dorm room at this hostel, assuming you didn't want to pay for a private room, you were put in the long-termers dorm room where six of us bunked, most of which were staying at least a couple months or more. So in this long-termer dorm room there was a motely crew of surfers, and Bob. I believe he was down visiting his son who lived in the area. I can't really recall the reason why Bob wasn't able to stay with his son and his son's wife, but remember thinking that Bob deserved better. Instead being able to stay with his son (who was in his late 30s or early 40s possibly), Bob was slumming it with the surf crew at the Bells Beach Backpackers. There was an abundance of good company, and good food so it wasn't half bad. When the tour busses came around twice a week, we'd often get free chicken and kangaroo leftovers from their large BBQ feasts out back. And we also had a couple of tasty homemade sushi nights.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I often wonder about how Bob is doing these days, whether he smoothed things out with his son, or is just enjoying his retirement in, presumably, Victoria BC somewhere. Where-ever you are Bob, I hope you are doing well! If you ever want some travel buddies after this pandemic, we can phone up the crew and head back to Torquay! Unfortunately it looks like the Backpackers is up for sale, but the owner never seemed like he had much fun interacting with his guests. Maybe the pandemic has killed the flow of international tourism to the area. But it will rebound again. There's always another backpackers down the road at Anglesea.

Just wondering if anyone know or has links to being a renter in Vic. I'm new here but our purchase is partially rented and I dont know where to begin with taking it on. 

1) the tenancy agreement i received was a fixed date tenancy that is outdated by 2 years now. I assume this means they're now month to month? 

2) If the agreement is outdated, do I have the right to have them sign a new agreement with us? And if so, are we able to renegotiate the terms, aside from the price because I think that's protected at a percentage per 12 months?

3) do we have any protection as landlords? I obviously wasn't able to vet these folks but we have a baby and I'm just nervous about who we're sharing half our home with. What if they're loud? What if they smoke? What if they bring around shady characters? I feel so old worry about these things but I am a new parent and am just trying to create a safe space for our baby.

Some questions, right now we live in a place that gets frequent school shooting threats. He is currently in a private school for many reasons this being one of them. How often do schools in Saanich go on lockdown? Have active shooter drills? Etc?

We are also coming from a place that seems to make national headlines frequently (think Nazi rallies, missing persons, school shootings) how often does Saanich make national news?

The teenager has recently found Magic the gathering and Dungeons and Dragons. Are there clubs at school for this or is there significant bullying at the local schools? Should we be considering a private school instead?

Also, grading. How does this work? I saw something about an 80% bring an A? Is this real?! How test focused are the schools? If our son were to go to the local high school here he would have three or four standardized tests a year and then the SAT or ACT for college admittance.

VictoriaBC,lastatlast,"The rental situation in Victoria So I'm fairly new to the city, having moved here in June 2015. 
Last summer, I moved into a rental in the Fernwood area, and this past weekend found a new one I'll be moving to in August.

I thought I'd share some info about the process and how it all came about given how many people seem to ask about rentals in the city.

First of all, **the rental market has changed significantly** between last year and this year.

Last summer, when I went to look at places, there might be 5 or 10 people looking at a suite. My current landlord showed our place last night and 45 people showed up in the 30 minute window!

This means **you have to be prepared** when you go to look at a place. 

* Have all the necessary information ready to fill out any applications (current landlord info, job info, personal details, etc.). You'll likely need references, so have them ready.
* Know the neighbourhood and have any questions ready
* If possible, have all potential tenants view the suite (both to get their approval and to meet the landlord)
* Be prepared to make decisions quickly (some people had cheques ready to sign...). This means both knowing about your own situation and needs and asking the right questions - making sure you can afford the place (obviously ask about all costs), understanding the parking situation, any other tenants in the building, etc.
* Be ready to sell yourself like in an interview. It's a seller's market in a sense and you have to make a good impression. Make sure you talk to the landlord (don't just fill in an application and hope they get back to you), mention how you'd be a good fit, and then follow-up shortly after you fill out the application.

Really though, you need to put in work before you even go see a suite. Set up email alerts on UsedVic and Craigslist, etc. based on where you want to live and follow up immediately (this is the only reason I was able to find a new place).

* When you write or call in response to an ad, provide some information about yourself and other potential tenants. 
* Offer to meet whenever they're free. Again, in a seller's market you have to work on their timeline. I had to cut a lunch date short to go see a new place 30 minutes after it was posted online. He had 50 emails by the end of the day for the unit.
* If you have a pet, bring it up early and focus on how you deal with the common issues that landlord's might think about regarding pets. Will the pet be left alone during the day? House trained or not? Interactions with other people, children, etc. 

Hopefully this helps a few people.

VictoriaBC,lavaslippers,"Victoria Transit missing buses regularly For six months I've noticed four separate times when between one and two buses on route 26 simply don't exist. Calling BC Transit yields nothing, just as the drivers of the buses that do show up know nothing.

Does anyone know what is causing the bus system to totally fail like this?

Ten years ago I first noticed this happen with a number 22, and it's happened now and then since. But the 26 is the least likely of all the buses I've used to actually show up. Victoria transit is reliably late or early by ten minutes, which itself is inexcusable, especially when contrasted with the efficiency of Vancouver transit, but to have buses simply not show up is pathetic.

And no, I am not alone in this, as there are others who ask the drivers the same questions when I do finally get a bus. Sometimes I even have company at the stops where they don't show. It only adds insult that BC Transit doesn't have any answers for me.

Edit: Looks like there are a lot of us. Good to know I'm not living in an insane matrix.

It looks like the government is against public transit. Why else would funding and service reliability be suffering so? It seems the more the service is reduced in quality the fewer people can use it the more ammo the government has to support the idea it isn't worth funding.

Me and my roommates moved in to a house in September and since then many of us have had persistent sneezes, coughing and runny noses constantly.

At first we discounted it as just being a cough we get when we go out but I am starting to think it may be black mold.

When we moved in our landlord mentioned that the roofing was replaced because of leaking and you can see visible damage in some parts of the ceiling.

He was diagnosed with schizophrenia through going to the ER at RJH last spring 2021. They gave him meds and a psych appointment to follow up, but he went for the first few weeks until he got a job and wasn’t able to make the appointments. He soon stopped the meds and has since then been quite overwhelmed by many symptoms.

The parents and brother are living in one house right now and really struggling. Lots of angry yelling and days of silence/not leaving his room. They try to support and encourage him as much as possible, but it seems like he’s not able to receive their help. They’ve contacted the BC Schizophrenia Society, but have yet to hear back.

Their parents are both nearing 70 and would like to downsize and sell the house. Ideally they would like him to move out, but they don’t know how to facilitate this in a safe or healthy way. With the renting market being what it is, he wouldn’t be able to afford his own place. As well as his mental illness would make it quite difficult to find a roommate.

Specifically, the recent issues surrounding the pipeline and the underlying native issues that involve 95% of BC land and historic abuse?

I don't have the answer, but I have talked to many people and done some research into it, and gotten a lot farther than most sources I've seen. 

***However, trying to discuss this in a public place is damn near impossible:***

On the **protester side**, there's a lack of intellectual honesty and well, intellectual ability altogether. The result is gatekeeping and red herrings. Deep down, I suspect many protester arguments ignore native agency, and in their own way are a redux of the ""noble savage"" mythos. I also suspect protesters to be hijacking and amplifying divisions in native communities in pursuit of an pseudo-environmental agenda. This means after the party is over and all of the protesters click their heels and go back to school, the natives are left with the same problems but now have to pick through the rubble.

On the **anti-protester side** it's pretty much, well, ""settler mentality"". The reality is that Canada's actions have put genocide and Canada in the same sentence (check out rape and mortality rates in residential schools, which continued into the 1950s). The average anti-protester in r/Canada ignores this. The ""rule of law"" that they so cherish has explicitly been broken by Canada, and almost all the land we sit on belongs to the natives—if the law was properly applied we would basically give all of our taxes over and it would be us corralled onto tiny reservations begging for handouts.

The above divide is hard to bridge. 

Now, even the above characterizations are generous in many cases. Many protesters can't identify the substance the LNG pipeline carries or explain what happens if a spill occurs. On the other side, people who might be hot off a comment bashing China, act like the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is written in Mandarin and effectively demand that we import anti-protester tactics from the Middle Kingdom.

I did not want the vaccine -- YET. I wanted more time to be comfortable with it. This side of me came from my mother who is a hardcore, extremely vocal and influential antivaxxer. I always knew she and I thought differently but... she's a part of me. I am skeptical, I wanted more time to be comfortable.

Fast forward to today. I wanted more time but also knew I was on the verge of being ready for it. With the passport being mandated as of today I woke up knowing it was time. I knew it was a hard conversation I was going to have with my mom. I didn't expect it so be *so* hard. She fought. I stood my ground. An hour before I was to head to the clinic I got a call from her saying that I was akin to a Nazi. In fact she said ""I hope when you think about the Holocaust you recognize that you are the same as the Nazis who pushed the Jews into the gas chambers because that's who you are, you little psychotic b\*\*\*\*. I never want to talk to you again"" and hung up. I cried a lot. I still wanted to go through with it. Being brand new to Vic, I only had a single friend here who supported me and took me to the clinic. With his support I was ready, again. as I sat with (Kyle?) the intake guy, I got a text from my mom saying that she was crying and remembering our memories when I was a kid, when things were good between us. That life tore us apart and that she couldn't stand to see my face so she put away our family photos because I was dead to her now. I teared up in front of Kyle... he noticed and offered me a private room. His eyes softened, I felt his empathy.

When I sat with Vivian, the nurse. She saw I was upset. She was so kind. She talked me though it until I started crying -- she thought I was afraid of the needle and I never corrected her but regardless, she was kind. She gave me a box of tissues and made small talk until I calmed down. She gave me a quick jab and more empathy than I could've imagined. I went to sit in the waiting room and cried harder than I've cried in a long time. Another nurse came up to check on me, another person I am grateful for.

None of these people knew my story. To them I was the person who didn't get vaccinated until I had to. To them, I should've been the problem. But they were so, so kind to me.

Sitting in that chair I actually said out loud ""how can these people be Nazis? They're so kind"" and it helped me so much to process these emotions surrounding the guilt I feel right now. I am so thankful that I wasn't brushed off as only 'the idiot who waited'. I had no idea how much these peoples support would mean to me in my healing process.

Thank you to everyone who was here for me today despite not knowing my story. I am forever grateful for you.

This meant we had to find a new place to live. We acted quickly and signed a lease for a new space which is $350 more per month. We began planning our move which included hiring movers, packing up most of our things, hiring a carpet cleaner for the apartment we’re moving out of as per the tenancy agreement, etc. We emailed our intended move out date to the property management company. Today, 1 week out from the move, we get a call from the property management company saying that the owners no longer want to move back in because they got a great deal on another condo and that we can stay. They did this knowing we already signed another lease and provided our move out date. It seems like they had a plan all along to get us out so they could up the rent prices… we’re not sure what to do. Also we found out from others in the building the owners got this condo for a great deal because they had a sob story about how they were disabled and needed it for accessibility reasons then never even lived here and immediately began renting it out. It’s all very shady and seems unfair and like a big shitty loophole. We definitely intend to seek legal advice next week, we were just hoping someone in here may have advice in the meantime.

Edit: Yea we were given a formal notice via email right after the phone call I received 3 weeks ago.

VictoriaBC,madastronaut,"CRD Drinking Water Quality FYI I recently went on a deep dive into the drinking water here in the Capital Regional District after I suspected my tiostar Stromanthe might be having adverse effects from the tap water (a very finicky plant, as it seems our tap water is better than most). Accessing and understanding the information was not as easy as I'd hoped, but I thought I would post the most helpful links here for others that are interested.

The [CRD website](https://www.crd.bc.ca/service/drinking-water/systems/regional-water-supply-system) provides a regional map of the water supply reservoir and the supplied region, as well as a very basic overview of how the water is treated in the region (with UV light and free chlorine, the latter of which is combined with ammonia to form chloramine).

The [district of Saanich](https://map.saanich.ca/html5viewer/?viewer=Public) has detailed map of the Saanich area with numerous overlays, including water lines, reservoirs, pumps, etc.

The [CRD website](https://www.crd.bc.ca/service/drinking-water/drinking-water-quality) also provides drinking water reports both annual (large report) and weekly (local, very minimal reports) and [an explanation on how to interpret the local ones](https://www.crd.bc.ca/about/data/drinking-water-quality-reports/explanation-of-headings-used-in-the-water-quality-tables) (note: the ""CL2 residual"" is a measure of the concentration of all chlorine species present, which appears to be largely dominated by monochloramines).

This is [a link to last year's annual report](https://www.crd.bc.ca/docs/default-source/crd-document-library/plans-reports/drinking-water/2018-greater-victoria-drinking-water-quality-annual-report.pdf?sfvrsn=66a6b0ca_2) from the CRD website, which contains many interesting tables of physical measurements, including CaCO3 hardness, pH, metals, inorganic compounds, etc.

Also informative is [this list of CaCOs hardness](https://www.aquatell.ca/pages/water-hardness-level-by-city-british-columbia) of drinking water in various BC cities. Appears to be formulated with 2016 data.

The [Canadian federal website](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/programs/consultation-chloramines-drinking-water/document.html#ii) provides an extensive report on what the science says about chloramines in drinking water with respect to public health, environmental impacts, chemistry, etc. Tricloramine is volatile and will evaporate relatively quickly, dichloramine is less volatile, and monochloramine even less so, which is why chlorine levels in the drinking water are dominated by the monochloramine species, and also probably why my plant doesn't like the tap water.

Edit: after a bit of googling, it appears it is not very easy to remove chloramine from tap water. Dechlorination solutions used for aquariums may work, boiling and aeration may work to a limited degree, activated charcoal filters I think are probably the best way, and campden tablets work as well I think, but the “best” way will depends on it’s intended purpose.",Service provider ,0,False,0.0

VictoriaBC,madmansmarker,"Should we plan a march or something for housing? I want to change things so badly and I am tired of passive activism. What do we do to change our city, our province, our country?   
Politicians know people are struggling and desperate, but so little is being done. I would say we need a march for housing and wages, but usually protests work best if they have one defined objective (which we learnt from Occupy Wall Street).    
I am aware there are many tenant advocacy groups and non-profits, I am part of many, but I think it’s high time we put our empty wallets where our mouths are.   
I know some people in this subreddit will be opposed to this and I’ll get some colourful comments, but I can’t just watch things unravel. It’s maddening how bad things are. How expensive. How unchanging.     
It’s frustrating how often people respond to concerns about the state of things with “move”. The housing crisis is catching. Moving to a different city, province, country won’t change anything.   
It doesn’t have to be a march if anyone has a better idea. 
I implore you all to use your voice to drive change. Vote, be an active citizen, help educate others whenever possible.    
Does Victoria have any non-partisan political/civic engagement education programs? Somewhere to learn more about government policies, crucial issues, etc. If so, I’d love to be a part of that. If not, I’ll start my own.

> 28 March 2018

>Dear Empress Hotel:
This may seem like and unusual request, but I write to you today, seeking a “pardon”.

>17 Years ago a string of unfortunate events led to my being banned from your hotel. I would like to explain the incident……

>In 2001, I had recently joined my current employer, xxxxxxxxx and I was also in the Canadian Naval Reserve. xxxxxxxxx was hosting a customer conference at the Empress and it was my first event with the company.

>I told my Navy buddies that I was coming out West and I was asked to bring “Brother’s Pepperoni” from Halifax. It is a local delicacy. Because this was the Navy we were talking about, I brought enough for a ship. In a hurry, I had completely filled a suitcase with pepperoni for my friends. Some of it was wrapped in plastic, some in brown paper. I took whatever Brothers would sell me.

>This is the bag that the airline misplaced.

>The bag reappeared the next day. I knew that the pepperoni would still be “good”. It had only been at room temperature for a short time. It would, however, be quite some time before I could turn it over to my friends.
Just to be safe, I decided that I should keep it cool.

>My room was a nice, big, front-facing room on the fourth floor. It was well appointed, but it did not have a refrigerator. It was April, the air was chilly. An easy way to keep all of this food cool would be just to keep it next to an open window. I lifted one of the sashes and spread the packages of pepperoni out on the table and window sill. Then, I went for a walk…..for about 4 or 5 hours.

>When I had covered enough ground, I returned to the hotel. I remember walking down the long hall and opening the door to my room to find an entire flock of seagulls in my room. I didn’t have time to count, but there must have been 40 of them and they had been in my room, eating pepperoni for a long time.

>In case you were wondering, Brothers’ TNT Pepperoni does NASTY things to a seagull’s digestive system. As you would expect, the room was covered in seagull crap. What I did not realize until then was that Seagulls also drool. Especially when they eat pepperoni.

>I’m sure you have an image in your head. Now remember that I have just walked into the room and startled all of these birds. They immediately started flying around and crashing into things as they desperately tried to leave the room through the small opening by which they had entered.

>Less composed seagulls are attempting to leave through the other CLOSED windows. The result was a tornado of seagull excrement, feathers, pepperoni chunks and fairly large birds whipping around the room. The lamps were falling. The curtains were trashed. The coffee tray was just disgusting.

>I waded through the birds and opened the remaining windows. Most of the gulls left immediately. One tried to re-enter the room to grab another piece of pepperoni and in my agitated state, I took off one of my shoes and threw it at him.

>Both the gull and the shoe went out the window.

>By this time, I was down to one gull left in the room, but it was a big one, and it didn’t want to leave.

>As I chased it, it ran around the room with a big hunk of pepperoni in its gob.
In a moment of clarity, I grabbed a bath-towel and jumped it. It stated to freak-out so I wrapped it in the towel and threw it out of the window.

>I had forgotten that Seagulls cannot fly when they are wrapped in a towel.

>This is all happening fairly quickly and this is mid-afternoon. The Empress hosts a very famous and very popular “High Tea”. I suspect this is where the large group of tourists was heading when they were struck by first my shoe, then a bound-up seagull (the seagull was unharmed, by the way).

>Let’s go back to my little housekeeping issue. The room was BAD. There was a lot of damage.

>I was new to my company and I was really trying to make a good impression at this important event. I decided that I would carry on for now and handle this whole thing later. I then realized that I had only a few minutes before an important dinner and that I only had one shoe.

>I made my way to one of the side doors and recovered both the shoe and the towel that were laying in some wet soil bear the walking path. The shoe was a mess. I took it back to the room. By this time, I had close the windows and the air was becoming quite ripe with the smell of digested pepperoni and fish.

>I went into the washroom and rinsed the mud off of my shoe. It cleaned-up nicely, but now I had one wet, dark shoe, and one dry, light coloured shoe.

>In retrospect, I should have just wet the dry shoe. Instead, I choose to dry the wet shoe using the little hairdryer. It was actually doing quite well. I had the hairdryer jammed in there and the shoe was drying quite nicely. Then, the phone rang.

>I walked into the next room to answer it and the power goes off. It turns-out that the hairdryer had vibrated free of the shoe and fallen into the sink full of water and the GFI didn’t seem be 100% functional. I don’t know how much of the hotel’s power I knocked-out, but at that point I decided I needed help.

>I called the front desk and asked for someone to come help me clean-up a mess. I can still remember the look on the lady’s face when she opened the door. I had absolutely no Idea what to tell her, so I just said “I’m sorry” and I went to dinner. When I came back, my things had been moved to a much smaller room.
>I thought that was the end of it all until I was told that my company had received a letter banning me from the Empress. A ban that I have respected for almost 18 years.

>I have matured and I admit responsibility for my actions. I come to you, hat-in-hand to apologise for the damage I had indirectly come to cause and to ask you reconsider my lifetime ban from the property.

>I hope that you will see fit to either grant me a pardon, or consider my 18 year away from the empress as “time served”.

>Thank you very much for your consideration.
Sincerely,

>Nick Burchill

>**Update 31 March**

I have a month to month lease.  the buyer owns the adjacent duplex unit and July first she'll take possession of mine too.  She recently completed full renovations on her unit after buying it the fall (moving into down from the mainland).  we've been in talks about continued tenancy since the fall as she's attempted to buy my unit previously.

thus far, the buyer has been very friendly, and open. we have been talking often. I've been loaning her my lawn mower, and garden hose and she's been asking me to watch her unit when she's out of town.  normal, friendly neighbour stuff.  

This spring, after I asked for a lease renewal, the LL tells me they are going to list the house immediately. I mentioned the neighbour's desire to own both and continue my tenancy.  They quickly did the deal with her (huge benefit to me, seemingly). Somehow, on the real estate paperwork, my LL indicated the unit was untenanted despite my month to month lease and my buyer referral who I specifically explained was planning to continue my tenancy. The lease was provided to the buyer (i know because the LL lost my lease and I had to make a copy of mine in mid April).  The buyer's proposed lease is not a renewal, but a brand new lease. It was very fishy: 10% rent increase and fixed terms (agreeing to 12 month move out plan WITH a stipulation about a renewal possibility 2 months from the end, also subject to another 10% minimum rent increase).  This felt very strange from the up-to-now friendly neighbour.

I obviously objected.  She declares she bought an ""untenanted"" house and can do whatever she wants.  I assert my right to continue my month to month lease at the current rent.  A week later the seller emails me a totally bogus eviction...no RTB approved form, just an email, with only 1 month notice, no compensation offered. I have to explain to them what  month to month lease is and how it protects me.  They argue about the wording but ultimately they realize their error.

I explain to the LL that I'm not able to negotiate this new lease with the buyer due to her feeling the house is ""untenanted"" (which is clearly dishonest of her) and unreasonable move out terms... I point out my tenancy is continuous, and that I have rights. He finally admits to this error says he'll work it out with the seller and get back to me.   He comes back saying the lease is fixed (regarding fishy move out terms) and that'll he'll offer me $600 to subsidize the big rent increase for one year.  I too will have to agree to $50 more per year (which is close to the legal max rent increase in BC).  I get the proposed lease back from the buyer, the move out terms are no different.  My LL has failed to actually convince the buyer to change change that details and now he's trying to trick me to do a rotten deal.

I go back the LL, tell him the $600 offer in sufficient considering the proposed lease is still fishy....that i'll end paying for it in year's time...I counter, asking for $2000 to accept her fishy lease and he acts as if i'm insane.  12 hours later he texts me ""$1250 FINAL offer""....but i don't reply since I wanted to talk to my roomie.  Then at 9pm, I get another text saying OK to $2000 but demanding to do the deal THAT night because the buyer is going out of town and is anxious. The late night meet up seemed inappropriate but also, i simply wasn't available. I reply in the morning explaining that I wasn't free the night before and that I still need to talk to my roomie  (who I still haven't seen) and that i'm about to go to vancouver for the night (band gig i was playing).  6 hours later i get a more official eviction email from the real estate agent (who represents them both) with a photograph of the paperwork on the door.  They couldn't wait.  Cleary my eviction was a condition of the sale despite it being illegal.

My roommate wants to move out, she has been so stressed with this situation, she's almost having a breakdown, falling behind with her work and getting in trouble from her employer.  She wants me to end our tenancy and take the free month (it's my lease so technically, so it's my free month but I can see her point and I do want to give her some reward for putting up with such nonsense).  The big issue is have no roomie to share this tenancy with so why dispute? i want to dispute, I want these liars to answer hard questions from an arbitrator but for what? continued tenancy in a place i cant't afford by myself? i can't, in good conscience bring a new roomie into such a precarious tenancy.  I feel so cheated.

I think i'm going to give up on this dispute and wait for the land lady to try to rent it again and fight this from a new home.  

Is there something I should do different?  I had crazy back up plan of disputing and trying to AirBNB the second bedroom.  the house is small but nice...not sure if it's worth the effort.


EDIT: thanks for the advice. even just seeing what comments go votes made me realize i just need to forgive dumb assholes for being dumb assholes. vengeance has never been my style.  i'm going to drop this notion of disputing, move on and hope my next LL is as great as many of my previous LLs were over the years (I've moved 6 times in 6 years so you know...it sucks but i'm capable and it's not the end of the world).  assholes will be assholes. fuck it.

i saw something glittering in the grass, and picked up a large ring. the colour is worn off in places and it's clearly not worth anything, but it's cool-looking. it's not an engineering ring and probably isn't a wedding ring. it was warm to the touch, so it'd clearly been there a few hours, meaning you probably lost it sometime between morning and late afternoon Saturday, September 2.

VictoriaBC,meauntienora,"Cat situation... Right, I know I'm accruing a LOT of bad karma for doing this but I am leaving the country on short notice and have not been able to find a home for my cat. He's an older cat who isn't a big fan of cuddling and petting but still wants to be in your presence and around your feet. So far four families have taken him from me and returned him back because he's loud at night. For some reason with me, even at night, he sleeps just fine but every other person who has tried to adopt him said the same thing: loud at night, scratches on bedroom door etc.

I've already tried websites like kijiji (even paid for a 7 day top-post) and still haven't found him a new owner. Not sure what my options are at this stage. And given the short time I have left in the country (a week), I might have to give him to a shelter. 

Can anyone recommend a shelter? I've googled around and really only found CRD animal rescue and the SPCA. But I couldn't find any information about GIVING the cat to them, only information about how to adopt one. Do these places take cats? Are there other, humane, places that I might be able to leave him?

Also if anybody else has suggestions about what I can do which doesn't involve giving the cat to a shelter, I'd love to hear. I'm pretty sure the mods would not take kindly to blatant advertising here or links to kijiji advertisements, so if you want to adopt a cat or want more info, message me privately.

**UPDATE: Thanks for all the suggestions. Yeah the SPCA and CRD are both full. BUT I was able to find him a permanent home with a family and they have previously dealt with cats that are similarly loud at night. He's been there for four nights now and looks like he's fit in perfectly! Hurrah for happy endings.**",Shelter,0,False,0.0

VictoriaBC,meekrab,"Need some advice on how to deal with a mentally unstable tenant living in my house. I don't know where else to post this, I was thinking /r/britishcolumbia, however /r/victoriabc has more readers.

I'm a renter and my landlord said that it would be okay to charge a tenant for living with me because the house is so big.

I met this guy about a month and a half ago. He seemed like a normal kid, friendly enough. The weeks pass on and he starts throwing temper-tantrums like a little kid about random things. He also has tried to get me involved in his personal problems (which he has a lot of). I called his father, and he basically confirmed my suspicions. He believes this kid to have bipolar disorder. Now, I'm no stranger to bipolar disorder, my mother has bipolar disorder, so I know what's up in that regard.

The main problem I am having is that the day before yesterday we had a falling out. He has stayed out all night (came back at 6 in the morning), trying to avoid me. All his belongings are still here as well. I'm worried he is going to try and move on the 1st and I need that money to pay overdue bills.

We signed an agreement stating a few things and one of them is that he would have to give me a month's notice before leaving. I'm planning on getting the rent from him for next month, then kicking him out at the end of the month.

Basically my questions are: If he does not pay the rent, he is technically still living in my house (he may not be here but his possessions are), and he has not given me one month's notice, what can I do? Can I hold on to his stuff until he pays me? He may claim not to have enough money, but I know for a fact his dad is wealthy. He also still has not paid me his security deposit, and he was late with the first month's rent. He violated the agreement within a week of signing it, but I needed the money so I still let him stay.

The reason I turn to Reddit for advice on this situation is that I don't know how legal this whole situation is. I'm technically not the landlord, but a tenant is paying me to live here. What rights do I have? We signed a contract saying he had to pay me a certain amount a month - he needs to give me a month's notice before leaving, etc.

I've had many tenants, (all of which, up to this point, have been friends) and I've had no trouble so I'm kind of in the deep-end here. Not too sure what my plan of action should be.

I will appreciate any and all advice. Thanks.","Evict, Evicted, Eviction",1,False,0.0

All the air polluters in our area:

a. When we first moved to Victoria, Schnitzer Steel had a metal grinding operation. Thankfully, now they just compact and transport metal (mostly cars) by barge at their facility at the end of Jutland Road. This operation creates lots of air-born dust and debris.

b. City Recycling: Ellice Recycling. Cascades Recovery. Enterra Environmental.

c. Composting yard adjacent to Bay Street Bridge.

d. The gravel operation and cement plants on Bay Street (Butler Concrete).

e. Not far away, the asphalt plant.

f. Sound pollution, all the noise that comes from these facilities.

We are resigned to dusting on an almost daily basis. We bought two Blue brand air-purifiers. They have helped. However, I am considering moving. Since last fall, I have been experiencing chest congestion. It just won't go away. I started using an inhaler, so far this does not seem to work. 

I find it odd that this area has such a high proportion of industry adjacent to a growing residential area. I realise that this has historical roots and that pollution was even worse 25 years ago. I also realise that this industrial base is a big tax base for the city and helps pay for the amenities  we enjoy.

We live on ceded territory of the Esquimalt and Songhees first nations. We have not done a great job as stewards/occupiers of their land.

I am considering buying an Indoor/Outdoor air monitor just to see how bad/good the air quality actual is.

I love Victoria, but I don't love its heavy industry. I understand the need for recycling facilities, but why so many in our area?

I feel trapped and I know I am not. I have the luxury and privilege of being able to uproot and go somewhere else. But, it would be a very difficult and painful move. 

The Selkirk Waterway area is an upscale area with expensive homes adjacent to many supportive housing facilities. Should the city be placing such facilities in an area with so much air pollution? What are the solutions and initiatives in place to improve our air quality?

I can easily take a short drive and cycle and be nourished by the forests at Mount Doug, Gowlland Tod, Mount Work, and East Sooke Park. Breathing fresh and unpolluted air just seems like something that should be a given. I despair when I think of our grand-children and great-grand-children and what they will face as adults.

Hi, everyone! I hope you guys are having an amazing day! My name is Mina, I'm Mexican (please forgive me in advance if this post seems rambly, I have a hard time being concise in English!!).

TL;DR: I'm asking for your help in answering/sharing a survey I created for my Master's thesis regarding nikkei Canadian familiar histories, specifically how internment during WWII could have negatively affected their approach to the Japanese part of their identity. This initial survey would help me find potential candidates for further interviews. Data from the survey/interviews will be absolutely confidential.

Edit: what the heck, here's the link to the survey, please let me know, if this is allowed: https://forms.gle/prbXhfmq1kgT5qvY6

\-----

I'm addressing all of you beautiful people with a request. I'm not sure if I'm violating the rule about self-promotion, If I am, please feel free to remove my post. Several months ago I posted on the sub regarding my Master's studies and the topic I'm researching for my thesis. Okay, on to the request!

I am a student of the Master in Global Politics & Transpacific Studies at the University of Guadalajara, Mexico. My area of specialization is Japan and its relationship with Canada within the framework of the Asia-Pacific region.

I'm currently working on my thesis, titled: ""An evolving identity: Nikkei Canadians and their approach to Japanese-ness after WWII. The case of Vancouver."" My purpose is to look at how the relocation and internment of Japanese and Japanese Canadians during World War II in Canada negatively affected the approach of those communities and their descendants regarding the Japanese side of their identity.

Part of the plan for my research is to interview nikkei Canadians who would be willing to share their families' experiences during WWII. To achieve this goal, I designed a survey focused on requesting information about their families' history living in Canada and whether or not they know of any relatives relocated to Canadian Internment camps during the war. However, the situation created by the pandemic made it virtually impossible for me to travel to British Columbia to apply this survey in person, I would like to ask for your help in a digital way!

I have sent requests for support to several institutions, including the Nikkei National Museum and Cultural Centre and the Japanese Canadian Association, among many others. However, my main goal is to contact individual nikkei people who would be willing to take the time to talk to me in some detail (and as in much depth as you are comfortable with) regarding this tragic part of Canadian history. Would you be willing to participate, or do you know someone who would?

I'm not sure if I can share the link to the survey here, so I'd better not. But if you are/know nikkei Canadians, would you be willing to send me a DM so I can share it with you?

I have letters signed by my Master's coordinator, although not addressed specifically to this subreddit (please let me know if you consider that a formal letter from my University would make you feel more at ease in trusting the intentions of this survey).

All data obtained through this exercise will remain confidential. No names or personal data will be published nor shared with any person or institution; they will be used only for statistical purposes and to find possible candidates for further interviews, which would also be voluntary.

I would love to reach as many nikkei Canadians as possible for this data to be a closer representation of today's Japanese Canadian community in British Columbia.

Thank you in advance for your willingness to help this student who is eager to learn more about the familial experiences of Japanese Canadians during the war.

From Central Saanich Police

Incident: Unlawful Occupation and Arrests at former Woodwynn Farm Property  

File Number: 2018-2207

On Friday, October 19, 2018 just after 10:00 p.m., a group of approximately ten individuals removed gates to gain access to the agricultural property located at 779 West Saanich Road. This location was formally known as Woodwynn Farms and is now owned and managed by the Provincial Rental Housing Corporation. The individuals drove vehicles onto the property and began establishing an encampment. 

Central Saanich Police Service officers responded and met with the organizer and several members of the group who identified themselves as the Namegans Nation or Camp Namegans. Police also spoke with representatives from BC Housing who instructed the police to remove the individuals. Repeated attempts to have the group voluntarily leave the property were unsuccessful.

This morning, officers spoke with the organizer and provided the group with another opportunity to leave the property voluntarily. The group chose to barricade the entrance to the property.

At 3:00 p.m., members of the Central Saanich Police Service, with the assistance of the Greater Victoria Crowd Management Unit and the RCMP, attended the property and arrested ten individuals for the criminal offense of Mischief.  The individuals are being released on conditions including not to return to the property.

VictoriaBC,monkey_monkey_monkey,"Johnson Street bridge builder has filed a lawsuit against the city Article from the TC

The new Johnson Street Bridge is built and in use, but legal wrangling over its design and costs continue.
In a lawsuit filed in B.C. Supreme Court, PCL Constructors Westcoast Ltd., the company that built the bridge, maintains design information for the bridge “was not accurate and complete” 

The suit seeking unspecified damages names the city, bridge design consultant WSP Canada Group Ltd. (formerly known as MMM Group), and Hardesty & Hanover, a sub-consultant, as defendants. The statement of claim, filed in Supreme Court in Chilliwack, says the city failed to provide design information in a timely manner, unreasonably changed the design (including specifications), and failed to pay PCL’s costs arising from changes.
Bridge project director Jonathan Huggett, representing the City of Victoria, said the lawsuit has been filed as a type of place-holder to preserve PCL’s right to sue while negotiations with the various parties over the issues continue.

“If you don’t file within two years of knowing something, you’re out of luck. So they haven’t served it on the city. There’s a difference between filing it in Supreme Court and actually serving it. It hasn’t been served on the city, but they have preserved their rights under the statute of limitations to pursue these claims,” Huggett said.
“There’s ongoing discussions with PCL, which I can’t get into for obvious reasons, but at some point we’ll reach a conclusion.
“PCL feel they have a claim. They have filed it to preserve their right to pursue that claim. The city will listen. The city will evaluate them and the city will make a recommendation to council on what should happen based on legal advice, on advice of the consultants,” Huggett said.
He said the same is true of a separate lawsuit filed against the city early in the year over design of the pier fendering, which protects the bridge from marine traffic.
WSP Canada filed a notice of civil claim on Jan. 30 seeking payment of about $300,000 for additional design work for fendering of the bridge’s north piers.
That suit, filed in B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver, says that at the direction of the city, the company provided additional professional services related to the design of fendering for which it wasn’t paid.
“It [the lawsuit] sits out there remaining at the moment because we are still in discussions with WSP about resolving the north side fendering,” Huggett said.
The lawsuits mean that for the taxpayer costs are still unknown, said Ross Crockford, director of the watchdog group johnsonstreetbridge.org. “Obviously the companies are not satisfied with the situation as it is right now and so the project is not completely over. It’s still going on and there are still outstanding issues,” Crockford said.
PCL lawyer Michael Demers did not respond to a request for comment by deadline.
Latest cost estimate for the bridge, not including fendering, is about $105 million. When citizens voted in the 2010 bridge referendum, the estimate was $63 million

VictoriaBC,monkey_monkey_monkey,"Third-generation landowner wants exemption from speculation tax From the TC 

&#x200B;

The third-generation owner of a waterfront property in North Saanich  is urging the province to create an exemption under its speculation and  vacancy tax for long-term owners such as himself.

His property — considered the family homestead — is not being held  for speculation, said retired businessman Malcolm Winspear of Dallas,  Texas.

The intention was always to keep it in the family, said Winspear,  who has a son and a daughter. But he is now weighing whether to hold  onto the site, purchased by his grandfather, philanthropist Francis  Winspear, decades ago.

Malcolm Winspear said it makes sense to grant an exemption from the  tax in cases such as his, based on length of owner­ship. The speculation  and vacancy tax is two per cent of the assessed value of a property.

This year, Winspear, who holds dual Canadian and U.S. citizenship,  and his wife, Jill, were each charged half the total amount of the  speculation tax, which totalled close to $40,000, for their Ardmore  Drive property.

“I’m afraid that it is becoming — now with this tax — so expensive that I may not be able to keep it,” Winspear said.

He anticipates rising property values will see the annual speculation tax reach $50,000.

Within 10 years, it could add up to $500,000 or $1 million over two decades, Winspear said.

The speculation tax does not include other property taxes levied on  property or the cost of upkeep. “It’s become a hugely expensive  property,” he said. “It’s really a case of: Is it appropriate to charge  that kind of money on a property that’s a vacation home?”

B.C.’s speculation and vacancy tax was announced in the 2018 budget,  aimed at reducing the number of empty homes and helping to tackle the a  shortage of affordable housing. It was intended to encourage owners of  vacant homes to offer them for rent or sell them.

The tax — which applies to Greater Victoria, Nanaimo, Lantzville,  Metro Vancouver, the Fraser Valley, Kelowna and West Kelowna — attracted  immediate criticism from affected property owners.

B.C.’s Finance Ministry figures that 32,000 people, or about one per  cent of homeowners, pay the tax. The province collected $115 million in  the 2018-19 fiscal year. Since then, the tax rate on foreign owners and  satellite families increased to two per cent from 0.5 per cent.

Renting is not an option for Winspear because the family wants to  continue having access throughout the year. Other exemptions to the tax  can include major home renovations, divorce, hospitalization and  extended absence.

Typically, the Winspears are at their Ardmore property three or four  months in a year, staying from a week to a month or so at at time, and  hosting other family members. They have been in North Saanich for the  past few months.

The 1940s house is about 2,000 square feet and is like a vacation  cottage, used for family get-togethers and recreation for decades. It is  nothing like mansions built on other Ardmore properties, where  assessments are high, Winspear said.

“If I’m third-generation owner of a property, why am I being charged  with a speculation tax that is intended for vacant properties or  foreign owners who don’t use them?” he said.

The Winspear family and its foundation have donated millions of  dollars to initiatives such as the Mary Winspear Centre in Sidney, the  Bessie Brooks Winspear Music and Media Commons at the University of  Victoria, and, in Edmonton, the Francis Winspear Centre for Music.

Francis Winspear was born in England and moved with his family to  Alberta as a boy, founding a successful accounting firm as an adult. He  died in 1997. Mary Winspear was his sister and Bessie was his wife.

It would be difficult to part with the property, Malcolm Winspear said. “I am very deeply attached to it.”

Winspear has moved a lot during his career. “This is the only place  that’s really been constant my entire life. I call this home. I just  don’t live here enough to avoid paying this tax.”","Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , Coordinated Access and Assessment , Reaching Home , The Cridge Centre for the Family , Victoria Native Friendship Centre ",1,False,0.0

I know 5 people thus far, 1 of which being family, who have had their indoor/outdoor cats murdered in nefarious ways by an unknown person. We have found multiple bodies, and I don’t want to go into too much detail because the whole thing is literally making me sick to my stomach…I’ve been puking on and off for weeks since finding out. There’s also been an uptick in missing cat posters which I feel could be related given the bodies we’ve found.

Also *please* don’t turn this post into a debate about why people shouldn’t let their cats outdoors. I fully agree that it’s dangerous for the cats, bad for the ecosystem/small bird population, etc. 

This is strictly supposed to be a PSA to cat owners within the area that let their kitties outdoors. 

Something similar was going on in the keating area about a decade ago and then it seemed to stop so I had just assumed the person responsible moved locations.

Sorry I made this post before having a large family gathering for the holidays so I’m only now having a chance to sit down and read everyone’s comments.

There’s alot so I’m sorry if I’m not able to answer everyone’s questions!

We have made reports to the police but other than making a file- unfortunately there’s not much else they can do (for now).

Will be reporting to the SPCA tomorrow, have already reported to a couple other locals cat rescues/organizations.

Yes predatory animals exist and I acknowledge it’s a possibility, quite a few people mentioned this and this could (potentially) be the case for a couple of the dead cats. But one cat was shot with pellets and the another was drowned in a sack. So there’s a possibility it could be a mixture of both? Either way I just wanted to warn people so that they could bring their cats inside if possible.

Wages should be higher than minimum wage,  but having to pay excessive wages just to ensure your staff can afford a place to live seems like a problem.  That expense is just going to someone's investment property.  

So why aren't business owners speaking out against rent prices? If rent was affordable they could retain staff and their business would be more profitable.  Instead employees are asking for business breaking wages because they need them to survive.  

With housing costs out of control,  any wage increase just goes straight to the landlord,  not benefiting the tenant,  not the business.  Small businesses can't afford to pay,  so they'll close and we'll be stuck in a city of chain restaurants,  big retailers and all our money will be caught in an endless cycle of big business employing us and we have no choice but to spend it with them.","Affordable, Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , Our Place, Victoria Women in Need",1,True,63.63636363636363

Victoria proposal would add 21.5 full-time staff for about $2.3 million




Victoria city council is preparing to approve a budget this spring that adds 21.5 full-time employees at a cost of about $2.3 million, according to figures released by the city.
Mayor Lisa Helps said council has achieved its goal of limiting the property-tax increase to the rate of inflation plus one percentage point, while still delivering new programs and services.
We’re a growing city and we’re a city that values quality of life, and city staff have a responsibility to deliver that quality of life and well being and I think that that’s what this budget does,” she said.
It’s unlikely, however, that the budget will receive unanimous support, since some councillors have already expressed reservations.
“I think, overall, the budget can be characterized as one where we’re biting off a lot more than we should be asking our taxpayers to chew on,” Coun. Geoff Young told his colleagues last month. “And some of the more fundamental things that we should be doing to make our city livable, we’re neglecting.”
The total operating annual budget is currently pegged at about $265 million, although that figure might change, as some numbers are still being finalized. The capital budget will be about $43.4 million.
Staff say the overall property tax increase is expected to come in at $4.68 million or 3.35 per cent.
When combined with utility fees, the total increase will be 3.32 per cent for the average homeowner and 3.26 per cent for the typical business, the city says.
Of the new employees, about half will be deployed to manage housing issues, new growth and a spike in large, complex development proposals.
Helps said six of the new jobs are for people who are already working for the city on contract.
“We hired people in the planning department thinking the building boom we’re seeing would slow down at some point,” she said. “But for the last four years it hasn’t, and all indications we have is that it’s going to continue at least for a couple of more years. So those positions have just been made permanent.”
Two of the other jobs are for bylaw officers to enforce the city’s short-term rental bylaw, and they will be paid with money from short-term rental fees.
The rest of the positions will be funded through new assessed revenue and are “absolutely defensible,” Helps said. The number of full-time city employees rises to 882 with the additions.
“The city’s growing and we need to make sure that we’re positioned to respond,” she said.
In addition to the new hires, the city is more than tripling its annual investment in the Housing Reserve Fund, which provides grants for the retention and development of affordable homes. The city will contribute $900,000 to the fund this year, up from $250,000.
Helps noted that that the grants are matched by other levels of government.
“So that money goes a long way.”
The city is also making significant investments to fight climate change.
Helps said 50 per cent of the city’s emissions come from buildings, and a significant portion of those come from home heating systems. So the budget includes $400,000 in “top-up incentives” to a provincial program that helps homeowners convert from oil to heat pumps.
“There’s a lot of oil tanks out there in the city and we’ve created an incentive program and staff support person to get their oil tanks out of the ground,” she said.
Young has already indicated that he’s opposed to the budget.
“We’re contemplating a very significant staff addition, in many cases to add new programs that may duplicate programs that other governments either are offering or should be offering or to top up programs like the oil tank program,” he told council.
Coun. Ben Isitt is also expected to vote against the final budget. He acknowledges that it contains many worthwhile programs and services, including housing, climate change and environmental protection initiatives. But he has said that he’s unwilling to support continual police-budget increases beyond the rate of inflation.
""It’s unsustainable and it might put me in the unfortunate position of not being able to support the overall city budget,” he said last month.
Council has signalled that it will likely approve the police department’s request to increase its budget by 4.43 per cent to $58.2 million this year, which includes the addition of a pilot project to hire four unarmed special constables.

VictoriaBC,mr_unhelpful,"Can someone explain to me why the Victoria Police are prioritizing their stolen bike over all other stolen bikes? Victoria has a problem with bicycle theft, and with property crime in general.

Usually, I'm the first person to speak up when people unfairly criticize the police. They have a hard job, and have to make tough decisions.

That's why this whole stolen police bike thing has me getting more pissed off every minute. From looking at the pictures provided, there is nothing special about this missing bike. A few accessories and a cheap ""POLICE"" sticker I could pick up on eBay for $2. Nothing particularly dangerous or sensitive, no risk to the public, and no chance that the thief would be mistaken for a peace officer cruising around on it.

The only real attribute that separates this bike from all the others stolen in the city is the owner. 

Because of this, we have officers assigned to the case who are actively following up on leads,reddit posts, and a solicitation for help from the public.

Why is this a priority? Why are more resources dedicated to this theft than all other bicycle thefts this month combined? Is there nothing else the police could be doing with their time?

I know it's early, but this screams preferential treatment to me.

VictoriaBC,mr_unhelpful,"Victoria council eases affordable housing stance amid backlash (TC article) https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/victoria-council-eases-affordable-housing-stance-amid-backlash-1.23492596

In the face of huge backlash from the development community, Victoria councillors Thursday eased off a proposal that would have immediately required all new condo projects to include between 10 and 15 per cent “affordable” units.
As an interim measure instead, they directed staff to negotiate an affordable component or cash-in-lieu feature in all future developments while working with stakeholders to develop an “inclusive” housing policy by March 31.
The “placeholder” measure will ensure “no more buildings with exclusively expensive housing are built that don’t make any contribution to affordability,” Coun. Ben Isitt said.
Urban Development Institute executive director Kathy Hogan had warned that development would have ground to a stop had the proposed policy been adopted. She said she appreciated the changes but they don’t go far enough.
Hogan said the uncertainty now facing developers likely means many will hold off on new project applications until they know what the city’s requirements will be.
“It doesn’t create any more certainty for the industry whatsoever,” Hogan said.
“In fact, it creates less certainty because there’s still these negotiations that need to be had. And you never know what’s going to be the outcome of those negotiations.”
In September, the previous council postponed consideration of a proposed inclusive housing and density bonus policy — which some councillors didn’t think went far enough — pending further consultation with the institute and other stakeholders.
A motion brought forward to council’s committee of the whole on Thursday by Isitt and Coun. Jeremy Loveday sought to resurrect that policy. They wanted it used immediately as the foundation for negotiations with developers wanting to build in Victoria.
Loveday said everyone agrees Victoria is in the midst of a housing crisis. “That means anything less than a crisis-level response, in my opinion, is a dereliction of duty of duty.”
Isitt said pushback from the development community was to be expected because the proposal would affect the profitability of projects, “particularly projects building expensive strata housing.
“The easiest way to avoid being caught by this policy is to propose rental housing rather than expensive strata housing,” he said.
Hogan said the new developments don’t create the huge profits that some suggest. “We’re in a tough time for development right now. Costs have gone up everywhere, in every aspect of the development. So it’s a hard industry to be working in right now. The risks are higher,” she said. “It’s a tight market. Their margins are not huge.”
The interim policy states that the negotiated inclusionary housing component should not compromise the economic viability of a project.
At Mayor Lisa Helps’ suggestion, councillors agreed to the creation of a working group with representatives of the development community, community associations, non-profit housing providers and rental advocates on developing an inclusive housing policy.
“One of the problems with this whole situation we find ourselves in is there’s really this ‘us versus them,’ where people don’t understand the economics of development, where people don’t understand what it means to be a vulnerable renter, where people don’t understand each other’s perspectives,” Helps said. “So rather than just simply inviting public input, I really feel a working group is the appropriate way forward.”
Hogan said her institute looks forward in participating. “I would like to do some research on other cities that have had successful programs that have brought in inclusionary affordable housing, and I think that’s what the city should be looking at and not implementing these policies that are uncertain,” she said.","Affordable, Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , Peer Housing Support Program, Victoria Women's Transition House",1,True,0.0

The atmosphere was what you would expect. I've never been told to f--k off or called stupid more times in my life than last night and it was pretty fun. Anytime you would make eye contact with a server you would get a serious glare or they would yell ""what the #%$@ are you looking at"" and it didn't get old. It was amusing and what you would expect. They have rules before you enter you need to read (no racism, no sexism, no homophobia etc) that are all common sense to any decent human being so there is none of that which is good. They have games that they play during the event made to humilaite people and get some laughs and again, it was fun. Lots of laughs all round. 

Now the bad. The food is abhorrent. There is very little selection which is fine. I didn't expect much in that was but I had hoped ut would've been somewhat passable as food. I ordered the chicken burger and got a shitty little burger on a shitty little bun with shitty french fries. Think of the budget bulk burgers you buy at walmart cooked poorly. Low quality. Low effort. I choked it down cause I was hungry and ordered some poppers from the bar (they were good) but my partner and I both remarked how gross the food was. 

Now the fun part. I was reminded of how bad the food was at 2:30 this morning as I violently puked my guts out. Oh man it was brutal. That chicken burger came back up with vengeance and it's a dangerous game if I stray further than 30 seconds from my bathroom this morning. It is awful.

So in short, the atmosphere and the staff at Karen's Diner was 5 stars. It was fun. There were many laughs throughout the night and all in all, it seemed like everyone had a great time.

My partner and I went to UVic, worked for a few years, finally saved up enough for a down payment, and were excited about the prospect of moving out of apartments and having a dog and a kid. We started to look for a house in February 2020 (yeah, amazing timing 😂).

Basically, housing supply has been awful, with a record low number of houses being put on the market (expected supply this year is half of last year's). Combine that with the fact that covid has caused a huge rise in demand: more people want to live in a house with a yard, lots of folks retiring early, etc. The average Vic single-family house price is \~$1.2M now.

I get that detached houses are going to get more expensive as a city’s density grows, but it’s insane out there right now. Over the past few weeks, we’ve put offers on houses and have been bested by people doing conditionless, cash offers $150K+ over the asking price.

I’m sick of seeing myself and my friends get squeezed out of the town that we call home, while nothing is being done about it. I am sick of hearing “we just need to build more supply” for over the past decade. Waiting for the market to sort itself out has not been effective.

Why don’t we take measures until the market cools down? Why are we not banning whole-home Airbnbs (1K currently active in Vic, 2-3K in greater Vic)? Charging people a 20% tax on top of the house purchase price if it’s not their primary residence? Increasing property taxes on people that own multiple houses and putting those gains towards efforts to increase rental supply? Banning buyers that live outside of Victoria? Or BC? Or Canada? Making it so companies can only buy condos and not detached houses?

It seems that with the levers at our disposal, we could immediately put thousands of homes on the market without hurting primary homeowners. This is not my area of expertise so I am just spitballing and hoping that somebody who knows better can chime in with actual answers. All I know is that a significant portion of people are pushed into renting right now when they would rather be owners, that the rift between haves and have-nots is already ridiculous and getting worse, that young & talented people are leaving to other cities, that homelessness is being exacerbated by affordability, and that staying our current course is going to further suffocate our beautiful city.","Affordable, Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , BC Housing, Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness , Homelessness , People with lived experience, Victoria Women's Transition House",1,True,0.0

Short-term we’d like to solidify our policies with more research/sourcing (1-2 weeks) and then reach out to councillors to find out which policies they support/don’t support (3-4 weeks). We want to clearly show which councillors are working to make Victoria more unaffordable and which are attempting to make it better.

Our efforts run parallel to the changes we’d like to see at a federal level (shout to r/canadahousing for that).

Check out our website and if this is something that you’re into, join our chat and work with us. The group and site are still in the early stages, so we don’t have all the answers yet. But we know that we must take action to make Victoria more affordable.","Affordable, Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, Victoria Women's Transition House",1,True,54.54545454545454

- Your winters are one of the mildest in the countries with average temperatures of 2 to 9 degrees 
- You're one of the driest cities in BC where rain is minimal, still cloudy from time to time. 
- It takes an average of 20-30 minutes to commute from most of your surrounding suburbs to the downtown core during rush hour. 
- You have a very chill and relaxed vibe, and a lot of hippies reside (which probably explains why you have the best weed in the country) 
- Your average jobs pay okay, but not enough to live through the expensive cost of living 
- The job market can be a bitch and quite competitive 
- Housing prices are high but something is being done about it by the provincial government. There is hope for prices to lower. Yet you are still more affordable than other Canadian major cities.  
- You are the only place where you can drive a few hours north to go skiing, or further south to go surfing.

The dealership couldn't help me, saying I was too far away for a tow, so I ended up having to use Just In Time Towing and Kal Tire in Langford.

Just around the curve between Head and Lampson there was a man standing in the middle of the road, right in the lane, where he could have easily been hit by someone going too fast around the curve.  I pulled over and called 911.  I immediately got someone asking me what city and what service (police, fire, ambulance), but then waited on hold for 6 minutes to talk to someone.  During the hold the person who asked me the initial questions could still hear me, but she said she couldn’t do anything or take any info on what’s happening.  When I was finally connected with an operator the guy finally staggered off the road, he’d made it up to the McDonalds.  He tried to open the door (locked) and then held on to the drive through sign post and collapsed.  They sent police and an ambulance.   

6 minutes to speaker to an emergency operator should not be acceptable.  During that time the guy could have been hit by a car.

They keep shrinking in the wash! Back in November I had distanced chat with a friend and really admired her extra thick and large mask that looked like a thicker knit and quite cozy, not this neoprene, sheer, stretchy crap everywhere that barely covers my chin and nose.  I asked her where she got it and it came from someone in UK. I didn't realize how far it would need to travel when I initiated the conversation but by the time I found out I figured what the heck, I really want these masks. So I purchased two and commenced waiting...and waiting....and waiting. Refusing to replace masks as they shrunk in the wash and began to rely more and more on disposable masks, which I dislike. Thinking, soon. My thick, durable mask will be arriving soon. Well, the other week the package finally arrived, empty. During the import process some handy mail person sliced it open, stole the masks and resealed the empty package.

Of course, I received a refund, was offered a new pair if I wanted. But at this point, I just don't want to wait another 2 months for a mask. Can anyone point me to some thick, comfortable masks in town? Honestly, I don't even know where most people are buying good masks. All the ones I've seen downtown seem to be made for children or just don't exist.

I want to support local and not Amazon. Can anyone help me out?

Hi! I'm planning a vacation to the downtown Victoria-Esquimalt-Sannich area this summer, and I just want to clear up a few things during my planning. We won't have a car and I'm thinking that taking transit and walking around will suffice during our week-long stay, but biking would be a nice experience as well.

* **How reliable/often is transit?** (I use public transit on a daily basis so it won't feel like too much of a hassle for me)

I plan to take the bus and water taxis, even up north to Brentwood Bay

* **Would you recommend bike rentals?**

I'm looking at Cycle BC. My main concern is the security of then bike. I mostly want to use the bikes to go to places like Thetis Lake, Francis/King park, go up Galloping Goose trail, Christmas Hill, seawalls. For biking and hiking. Currently deciding if I should do multiple day rentals or take it 1 day at a time.

* **Is it better to transit to the parks and then walk/hike?**

So there's less concern about leaving bikes before trails?


* **How safe is it to walk around these areas in late night?**

It will be light out until late in the summer but I just like to get a feel of things. (I don't mean it to be a rude question, there are places where I live where I definitely don't want to be around in the late night)

* **Would anyone recommend the stand-up paddle boarding at Brentwood Bay?**

I saw a Groupon for it. 2 hrs for 2 people. Neither of us have ever paddle boarded before, though.

VictoriaBC,nuke_dukem_,"StatsCan Analysis - TC Article She put down the Kleenex she was darning, looked a little wistful. “Or maybe North Saanich. It would be nice not to have to sell my other kidney.”

Yes, Victoria, there is a big disparity in earnings hereabouts, as reflected in income figures released by Statistics Canada on Wednesday. The findings were based on tax data from 2015.

Highlands, with a median household income of $103,509, topped the list not only in the capital region, but in all of Vancouver Island.

Next, at $103,296, was North Saanich (the Monte Carlo of the Peninsula), one of a handful of B.C. communities to hit six figures.

At the other end of the scale was the city of Victoria. Its median household income of $53,126, one of the lowest among larger B.C. communities, was well below the Greater Victoria figure of $70,283. Still, it was significantly higher than a decade previous.

It was also higher than Port Alberni, one of just three B.C. cities (the others being West Vancouver and Quesnel) where median earnings — that is, the point where half the households earned more and half earned less — actually dropped between 2005 and 2015.

Those were among the statistical snapshots that, when put together in one big national photo album, showed a shifting Canada — more growth in the resource-rich West, a wide but narrowing gap between men and women.

Among the numerical nuggets:

• Greater Victoria has a slightly lower proportion (13.1 per cent) of people designated as low-income than either B.C. (15.5) or Canada as a whole (14.2). The national rate hasn’t changed in a decade.

The capital region numbers range from a low of 5.6 per cent in Highlands to 12.3 per cent in Saanich and 19.8 per cent in Victoria proper.

• When broken into five-year age groups, stats show those Greater Victorians aged 20 to 24 are easily the most likely to be deemed low income, with 22.4 per cent fitting into that category. At the other end of the spectrum, just 9.8 per cent of 70- to 74-year-olds are deemed low income.

• More than 27 per cent of Greater Victorians in single-parent homes were low income, while under six per cent of DINKs (dual income, no kids) fit there.

• Among Greater Victoria male-female couples, both partners made roughly the same amount of money in 33 per cent of the cases. The man earned more in 49 per cent of the couples. The woman brought in more in 18 per cent. Those were close to the national numbers.

Compare that to 1985, when just 8.5 per cent of Canadian women made more than their male partners and only 21 per cent made comparable money. Where just two-thirds of women contributed income to a 1970s couple, it’s 96 per cent now.

• The median income of higher-income partners in Greater Victoria was $63,700. Among the lower-income partners it was $28,617.

• Across Canada, same-sex couples made more money ($100,707 for men, $92,857 for women) than opposite-sex couples ($87,605).

• Two-thirds of Victoria households contributed to an RRSP, registered pension plan, or tax-free savings account. That’s similar to the national rate. Unsurprisingly, the higher your after-tax income, the more likely you are to contribute.

• The number of households in Greater Victoria rose by 11.9 per cent from 145,435 in 2006 to 162,715 in 2016.

Oak Bay was the only one of 13 municipalities where the number dropped, a two-per-cent decline from 7,895 to 7,735.

No surprise that the greatest growth was in the West Shore, including a massive 63.4 per cent jump in Langford, where the number of households rocketed from 8,680 to 14,180.

• The commodity-rich West, including some places in northern B.C., saw more growth than Ontario and Quebec, where the manufacturing sector lagged. However, StatsCan cautions the 2015 tax numbers on which the findings were based were gathered before the full impact of the downturn in the oilpatch was felt.

Saanich woman recounts near-death COVID ordeal

Cathy Novak with her husband John McAllister.
Photograph By Times Colonist
Cathy Novak’s phone flashed “VIHA” and she got a sinking feeling. They’d said the previous day, when she took the drive-thru COVID-19 test, that she could call in a few days for the result.

But if it was positive, they’d call her.

article continues below

It was, so they did, on March 16. The call was the start of an accelerating decline that brought the 60-year-old semi-retired Saanich dental hygienist to the brink of death.

She spent 12 days unconscious on a ventilator and 16 days in Royal Jubilee Hospital’s specially equipped coronavirus intensive care unit. At one point, one of the doctors rated her chances of survival at 50-50. It took a month in hospital before she was well enough to go home.

In interviews and through notes she and her husband, John McAllister, made, the couple recounted the ordeal.

It’s now 10 weeks since she noticed what she thought were mild flu symptoms. She’s recovering, but is still dealing with after-effects. There’s a rash and some tremors in her hands.

There’s also a profound wave of emotions and thoughts about what she went through.

Novak has an enormous sense of gratitude for surviving, and respect for the work medical staff did in extraordinary conditions. And she’s determined to stay positive about the experience.

She also has a message: “Please don’t let your guard down prematurely. COVID-19 is real, and it doesn’t discriminate.

“You may feel indestructible, but it’s not just about you, it’s about all of us. When you take care of yourself, you take care of others.”

She was considered higher risk only by virtue of her age. Her health wasn’t compromised in any other way, yet she still had a severe experience with the pandemic virus. She’s still pondering the “why me?” aspect, but out of curiosity more than self-pity.

She was one of 15,000 attendees at the Pacific Dental Conference March 5-7 in Vancouver, which later became known as an important vector for the virus. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has noted that 87 cases just in B.C. were identified from the conference.

It was in the early days of the pandemic, before it was officially declared as such. Officials said they reviewed all their protocols with health authorities and were not told to cancel the event.

It was a typically busy convention, but Novak can’t trace her illness back to any specific moment.

One incident separate from the conference sticks in her mind.

She was on the SkyTrain after the conference closed on March 7.

“A lady three seats to my left sneezed. She was wearing a mask — wait for it … on her chin, not covering her nose or mouth. And she didn’t cover the sneeze.

“I gave her an eyeball-rolling glare, but she did not look my way.

“I can’t shake that moment in time, which feels significant to me.”

It was after work on Monday at home that Novak had momentary chills and had to clear her throat. She took some Advil. She and her husband started keeping their distance, as with a cold.

The next day, she was off work and shuttled her mother to some appointments. The mild symptoms returned in the evening.

The pandemic was officially declared that week by the WHO and the dental conference started featuring in the news.

She booked off sick from her two-day-a-week job.

“I started feeling uneasy, but I was thinking it could still just be regular flu.”

Island Health opened a testing centre at its Cook Street office and she booked an appointment there for Sunday, March 15.

“I was grateful for all the health-care providers putting themselves at risk on our account. The testers were in full protective equipment. One approached my car with a sign that said: ‘Please roll down your window.’ ”

The nasal swab was taken, “not the most pleasant test.”

The call came at noon the next day. “Oh my God! I have the coronavirus. What now? This COVID got super real for us.”

Novak was one of 30 new cases counted that day. B.C. had 103 cases at that point.

Still optimistic, she relied on the fact people elsewhere had mild cases and recovered easily without needing hospital care.

Island Health told her to keep monitoring her symptoms, and started daily calls to check on her and McAllister.

“John was still asymptomatic. We quarantined and continued to social distance with each other, but with more purpose.”

Novak offered to get the names of patients she’d treated before her symptoms developed, but Island Health was on the case.

They inventoried all her interactions and contacted everyone she’d had contact with.

“I am ever so grateful my 88-year-old mama did not contract it on that morning we spent together in the car at the doctors’ appointments.”

Her symptoms got worse through March 18, McAllister’s birthday. “It was so hard for us not to at the very least hug.”

McAllister said: “I couldn’t go anywhere near her.” He’d check her from the doorway to the bedroom, but it was frustrating to not be able to comfort her.

By Saturday morning, Novak said, “I felt like I was losing this battle despite all my efforts to turn it around.”

She decided to go to the hospital. The couple was instructed to call 911 for an ambulance.

“I struggled to get my yoga pants on, but was able to walk to the ambulance. I’ll admit I was petrified, discouraged and not sure I’d ever be returning home again, or in what condition.

“John and I waved goodbye, after 10 days of no hugging and no contact.”

The ambulance pulled away and that’s the last thing she remembers for weeks.

“I waved to her, and I stepped back in the house and burst into tears,” McAllister said.

What happened in the next two weeks is reconstructed from what McAllister told her later.

She was in an induced coma from March 21 to April 2. McAllister gave daily updates to friends and family: “Chatted with a doctor and he informed me that we got Cathy to the hospital at the right time. Had we waited any longer it would have been very hard to get her on the ventilator … ”

Novak remained stable for several days and the medical team was guardedly optimistic. One doctor warned McAllister, though, that her chances were 50-50. “My heart dropped, but I was glad he was being so honest and it brought me to a realization that Cathy might not be coming home.”

All the while, they were adjusting her oxygen and sedation levels and administering about two dozen medications.

She slowly returned to consciousness in early April. All she remembers is a recurring, disturbing dream of being restrained and needing to escape.

“I even made a mental note to bring scissors next time I’m in hospital to set myself free.”

She spent a few days in a state of confusion, but her mind gradually cleared. She was constantly shocked and frightened at how weak she was. She couldn’t speak for a few days and when her voice returned, she couldn’t pronounce words properly.

Her phone seemed to weigh a tonne. Even her glasses felt heavy.

She thought it was absurd that a nurse and physiotherapist were both at her side the first time she tried to stand with a walker.

“Spotting me? How silly.” She was going to do a dance step to show them. But she could barely stand up.

“I was devastated by how much recovering I had to do.”

She also noticed how complicated the care routines were. Everyone entering her room had to fully suit up in protective gear, then clean everything they touched and discard all the protective gear when they left.

A shortage of personal protective equipment meant care had to be streamlined, so as many routine functions as possible were done at one time. That created difficulties and frustrations.

The isolation was difficult. No hugs, no visitors, just phone calls from McAllister.

Novak said the caregivers tried to make up for that. “They made me feel like a superhero for surviving and beating COVID.”

She walked out of Royal Jubilee Hospital on April 20 — 15 pounds lighter — into McAllister’s arms. They shared “the longest bear hug ever.”

Both broke into quiet tears.

Dr. Omar Ahmad, emergency and critical care department head, said Novak was one of their earliest patients, and staff at that point were still getting used to the cumbersome new protocols.

“It changes how we practise medicine.”

Nurses, in particular, have to plan every step in advance and can’t just routinely call for a hand as before.

“It’s very challenging and exhausting.”

Job one for Novak, after looking out the window at the Tim Hortons sign for days on end, was to get a chocolate dip donut.

She noticed on the drive home that the streets seemed deserted, a sign of how much things had changed.

Their neighbourhood staged a huge homecoming with signs and balloons. There was a big Zoom call with friends and family. But there have been constant reminders of how weak she is and how much more recovery lies ahead.

She said one of the hurdles is that she gets frustrated with how quickly she gets frustrated.

Over the recovery, she learned more about the details of her case. Doctors told her she had a severe case and had been in critical condition. Going to hospital one day later could have been too late.

The number of B.C. cases went from 348 to 1,699 during her month in hospital. Deaths went from eight to 86.

She and her husband of five years had some deep conversations the first few days back, and feel even more connected as a couple.

“COVID-19 has been destructive and traumatic, yet also empowering and uplifting,” she said. “Surviving gifted me the chance to reflect on my life and I got to know myself better and accept myself as is.”

I did do a bit of research into the subreddit and found a few opinions from people who did make the move, but those were from a few years back and I’d like to get an up-to-date view on things. 

From what I gather:

- Idyllic weather (I guess ideal weather is different for each person but it seems pretty decent year round in comparison to Ottawa which goes from -30 to +30 😭 and is mad humid at all times) 

- Real estate seems to be more considerably expensive in Victoria, do housing costs go down reasonably in nearby cities in Vancouver island? Cost of living seems to be decent overall

- Ample job opportunities in a lot of growing fields, both private and public 

- Proximate to Vancouver and Seattle, I assume taking the ferry may be a hassle though? 

- Faces reasonable natural risk due to the effects of climate change, a point to consider for the long-term

Beacon Hill Park.  Gardens,peacocks, beach, floating islands, the most incredible totem I've seen in person... met a fellow who gave us a prophetic and refreshingly positive message from his spirit guide. 

abkhazi gardens.  What a tiny treasure. I now have plans for my own rhododendron forrest

Butchart gardens. Once during the daytime. Once at night.

Daytime revealed an impressive operation Like Epcot center with no rides just tourists (i am a type of one myself of course).  Heard whining kids in every language.  Incredible how similar they sound and how alike the poor parents baleful expressions. The cruise ship life.  Not my crowd.  I only ever saw them here.  Not anywhere else i visited.  Also thanks to you guys i didn't risk the food.

Nighttime at Butchart was special.  As the sun set there wasn't a soul until nightfall. We sat in perfect absolute stillness in acres of scented summer air.

Craigdarroch was sinister af.  Not a castle at all.  A homage to a seriously not nice fellow and his Gothic Scottish obsessions.  We had a few (thousand) like them in the states too. At least i met a pack of golden labs and  had stimulating conversation with their human guide.  


Blue Fox. Twice. Double entrees for both of us so we could try all the breakfasts. Bennie game strong and that bagel is straight controversial.  Full English.  Banana pancakes. Everything dialed to hipster levels of perfection.

Oreganos 🍕 pizza. Got 4 pies. Rivals any New York.  Garlic oil. The red sauce. Thin crust and regular. Just exquisite.

Chicken 649.  It's the chicken that's special. Sauces really good. Sides ok.  But that chicken itself is a light crunchy wonder.  And they cut the breasts up across the grain so the white meat is as good as the dark.

Fishhook.  Indonesian seafood...man! What else are you hiding in this town?

Kid sister.
  I had just left a gluttonous gorging at Little Yunnan by fantan alley.  I was full.  So full.  And also on fire.
I walked in there thinking I'd try a sample.  Mebe a single scoop.
I left with 3 scoops (organic vanilla, chocolate, lemon meringue) and 2 freshly made cones.  

Honorable mention goes out to lotus land cannabis.  Got an ounce of flavors that kept us well lifted.  Strawberry ganja that actually tastes like strawberries... Incredible.

The new prices are out, and they're up well over 66% of what they were when I started going there three years ago (it was somewhere between $30-35 a month). The new CEO came around in January and hiked prices by 20% and reduced hours by 10-15% and were planning on cutting hour even further during summer. Now they've hiked it *again* to $51 a month for a basic membership without access to the plus change rooms.  


As an organization that is supposed to be a non-profit, I find it absolute bullshit that they have been consistently increasing prices while pay has been relatively stagnant. The turnover rate there is egregious, and a few of the guys who worked the front desk ended up running classes to keep their free Y membership after they quit. I run into some of them in those classes and it was nothing but horror stories.

I saw the old CEO's vehicle parked outside one day. Brand new Cadillac (I think it was a CTS) with Brembo brakes and all the bells and whistles. The new CEO just came from Van City banking. Why are you allowing corporate assholes to come in and ruin what was once such a great thing for the community? We want people to stay fit and healthy so that our healthcare system isn't overburdened down the line. Now the memberships are comparable if not *more* expensive than other for-profit gyms (Anytime is $50 a month).  


Anyways, I apologize for the rant, I just think it's complete bullshit that this is the path a once well respected facility took. It went from affordable and community focused to hiking prices and slashing hours.

VictoriaBC,one3zero8,"New tenant for the old Sears location in Hillside Mall. Who do you guys think it will be? From the TC.

A new anchor tenant will open its doors in the old Sears location at Hillside shopping centre in two years.
Hillside’s owners, BentallGreenOak, have confirmed a new retail tenant has been secured for the 150,000-square-foot space that was home to Sears for nearly 50 years. No names have been revealed.
Rahim Ladha, Bentall’s vice-president of corporate communications, said efforts are underway to prepare for the tenant’s arrival. “Though I am unable to confirm the name of the new tenant at this time, I can share that we expect the space to be open to the public in fall 2021,” Ladha said.
Rumours have swirled about who would take over the massive, two-level retail space since Sears closed its doors for good in January 2018. Tenants such as Walmart, Ikea and Costco, and residential redevelopment have been kicked around as options.
Bentall considered splitting up the site into smaller parcels, but it appears the single-user option has won the day.
Commercial real estate expert Randy Holt said Bentall will have saved itself a lot of headache and hassle in opting for one user.
“It’s risky to carve it up for a tenant and try and deal with the balance of the space,” said the veteran broker from Devencore Victoria. “Once you start down that road, there’s no turning back.”
Holt said it’s a surprise that there are single tenants able to take on that kind of space. “There are not a lot of players these days for space that size,” he said, adding it’s also difficult to find that much space in one location.
Whichever player moves in has every reason to expect success, he said. “Hillside is such a great location to serve the east side of the city.”
Holt said the commercial real estate market in Greater Victoria is generally vibrant, with office space in high demand, industrial land in short supply and retail space as good as ever.
Sears was the anchor tenant when Hillside opened in 1969.
It had a 20,000-square-foot Sears Auto Centre at the corner of Shelbourne Avenue and North Dairy Road, which was demolished in 2012 to make way for expansion of the shopping centre.
The Sears store’s final day was Jan. 8, 2018. Sears Canada filed for creditor protection in June of 2017.","Victoria Native Friendship Centre , Victoria Sexual Assault Centre",0,False,12.5

VictoriaBC,onion_thyme_jam,"What motivates someone to go into politics, and what should? So this could be cynical of me, but I get a bit suspicious seeing someone super young with no work experience go straight into federal politics. If one was super keen to get into politics for the right reasons, I feel like you’d start at a municipal level. You’d get a chance to work on tangible changes in your community, learn the ins and outs of politics, and gain experience. From here you could move to federal politics and be more confident and capable. Alternatively, years of relevant work experience could also give you skills and an understanding of issues that would make you a strong candidate for your riding. Seeing someone running in the federal election fresh out of their undergrad feels a bit like they’re looking for a resume booster and that they’re not willing to put in the time to have a sustained and effective career in politics fighting for the issues they care about. 

I want to be clear: I’m a huge fan of more young people in politics, but I also understand that it’s a tough job and I want to be represented by someone with skills and lived experience that they can bring to the table.

Fellow Victorians! Up your game. Windsor ON beat us out as the Karen Capital of Canada with an astonishing 64.83 Karens per 100K capita. We came in second in the nation with a paltry 15.86 per 100K, which means we have a lot of work to do with excessive complaining and unreasonable demands.

Following this sub, I think Victoria is doing just fine in the mistreating service workers category. South Oak Bay, you're good and don't need to do more. But there needs to be some team effort here from the rest of the CRD in demanding to speak to a manager today.

We have a way to go to take the title from Windsor, but those in third are apparently way behind, so this is a two-Karen (and Kenneth) race. Go Team Victoria!

Ok, it's the National Post and an unscientific poll. You got an issue with that, take it to the manager.

My friends, my hobbies, my career, my partner, everything is here. To tell people they should leave instead of fixing the issue is just going to make it worse. I also hate the ""well it's the nicest part of Canada, it should be expensive!"" because the most expensive city in America is NYC, not exactly balmy. Good weather shouldn't be an excuse to price out locals or people who need to move here for whatever reason. It sets a scary precedent IMO to allow nice places to be just for the mega rich. 
I don't know. I've been thinking a lot about victoria and the responses to the housing crisis. I'm going to be without my support network, hobbies, career, and everything I know just to afford rent. this isn't fair. EDIT a lot of people are completely missing my point, and thus reinforcing it.

VictoriaBC,ouronlyplanb,"Hey Victoria programmers. I'd love some insight. School, Coding Boot Camp or just keep on the self teaching? Hey all,

**TL:DR Should I go to school, do a boot camp or save my money?**

I am looking to leave broadcasting and get into the tech industry. Currently I've done several online courses/tutorials and feel comfortable with some basics in things like CSS, HTML, JavaScript and Java. I have not jumped into GitHub yet (I know its important so I'll be working my way towards it, currently I just don't think I have enough knowledge to be productive in it)!

I'd love to get a bit more instructor help so I've signed up for (school)[http://camosun.ca/learn/programs/computer-systems-technology/what-youll-learn/index.html] in 2017. I like this one because it has work terms, I find these are the best way to get hired, at least it was the case with my broadcasting degree. However the other day I saw this [Coding boot camp]{https://lighthouselabs.ca/) and I won't lie, I'm intrigued. 

I like the idea of an intense, highly focused, coding boot camp but do to my finances (it's 8000 bucks for 1 boot camp, and they offer 2, so 16000+ tax!)  I couldn'd do both the boot camp and the schooling in 2017. So option 1 is to go to school for two years or do option 2 - the boot camp.

My 3rd and final option is to just keep on self teaching, but it's slow going and at this rate I feel it may take me 1 to 2 years before I feel confident enough to apply for entry level jobs! I am also a bit worried about some comment like ""without school there will be holes in my knowledge"" etc. I'd hate to go into an interview and just get obliterated.

Anywho... I'm wondering if any local programmers could give me some insight on the schooling around town, other options or their own experiences.

My current interest is just to get into the tech industry, I'd like to eventually work in Java or even C# (but honestly Java's object oriented programming seems much more manageable).","Camp, Camping",0,False,0.0

VictoriaBC,picocailin,"Tabby cat at UVic Normally I'd post this in the UVic subreddit, but I think it's more likely the cat's owner would be watching this (if at all). But if [this](http://victoria.en.craigslist.ca/laf/4298778339.html) is your cat or you know who it belongs to, please get in touch with me!

It's been hanging around the SUB for a while now, and when I'm working people are constantly asking about it because it's so skinny the spine is able to be felt. There are people wanting to take it to the SPCA or adopt it, and as a cat owner myself I know how frustrating it can be when people assume wandering cats are homeless. Also, there are students feeding it muffins and sandwiches... So that's probably not helping either. 

I'm crossing my fingers that this cat has a microchip. 

Also, please don't use this as a forum to vent about irresponsible cat owners letting cats wander around. I'm just concerned about whether there is even an owner to hold accountable, and everyone already knows what everyone else thinks about outdoor cats.

EDIT: He's been brought to the SPCA by my coworker (maybe they aren't full?)

I  am wondering if anyone in this subreddit knows of any ways to access psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy with a trained and qualified therapist in Victoria that do not require an approved Health Canada special  access program request? In other words, I’m trying to figure out if there are any experienced and trustworthy therapists in the Victoria area (or potentially Vancouver) who provide psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy to people who don't have official approval for ""legal"" medicinal use.

VictoriaBC,poutineismylife,"A guide to navigating the medical system without a family doctor I was inspired by a recent thread to write a simple guide for navigating the medical system without a family doctor. This is a problem that affects so many people in Victoria and it results in patients slipping through the cracks. I hope this can help someone.

1.  **Always go to the same walk-in clinic.** I know it is convenient to use Medimap and go wherever the wait is shortest and I understand that this is sometimes a necessity, but going to the same walk-in clinic gives you some continuity of care as they will create a file for you. It is crazy that even with the technology we have today, there is no universal electronic medical record. Doctors can't access records from other clinics. If you are hospitalized for any reason, have the hospital forward your chart to the walk-in you utilize so that you can get any appropriate follow up. 

2. **Look up what screening tests are appropriate for your age group in BC.** Here are a couple guides to start you off. 

Women **-** [https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/tc4037#tc4044](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/tc4037#tc4044)  

Men - [https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/tc4037#tc4045](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/tc4037#tc4045) 

A walk-in clinic doctor is unlikely to track when you are due for screening, but they can order the tests when you are due. 

3. **Keep a personal medical record.** Buy a new notebook. Use fresh pages for different sections.

Page 1 - Medical history. This includes current conditions (diabetes, hypothyroidism, etc.) and significant past medical issues (heart attacks, recurrent pneumonia, cancers, etc). Include hospitalizations and the reason. 

Page 2 - Surgical history. Include all surgeries and whether you had any complications with the surgery itself or the anesthetic.

Page 3 - Medications and drug allergies. Include supplements and over the counter medications. For allergies, describe what type of reaction you have.

Page 4 - A list of the screening tests you are supposed to be getting and the frequency. Leave room to write in the  date whenever you get screened, so you always know whether or not you are up to date.

I recommend a physical paper copy as it is much easier for doctors to flip through quickly compared to a phone and can be photocopied if needed. Take this book with you to every doctor's appointment. This is the basic information that will help reduce the risk of things being missed by new doctors seeing you. 

&#x200B;

Well, I hope this is somewhat helpful. It is unfortunate, but becoming increasingly necessary that people take their health into their own hands. 

Tips for getting your own family doctor: if anyone in your family or close circle of friends has a family doctor, see if they are willing to ask at their next appointment whether their doctor takes a waiting list for patients when space in their practice opens up. Although family doctors do have patients move or pass away, they almost never publicly announce that they are taking patients because the spaces typically get filled through these loose social connections.","drug use, Healthcare , Social problem ",1,True,0.0

It's taken 30 minutes to go from the Leigh Rd exit to the Leigh Rd overpass, with no sign of traffic easing.  Save yourselves and choose another route, if possible

ETA: Not sure what the circumstances were but there was an accident which have occurred maybe 10-20 minutes before we got there. Google later rerouted people through Finlayson Arm but the route was clear when I confirmed directions when we left the house.

They were towing some cars out of the way when we got to Ice-cream Mountain. Looked like someone was trying to turn left coming out of the ice cream shop (aka crossing Malahat traffic heading to Langford).  My uneducated hypothesis is that someone stopped or slowed down to let the car turn and 2-3 cars heading northbound were involved in fender benders as a result. They were serious impacts with major body damage to the back of the first car - obviously the van behind them was not paying attention! The car turning stayed behind and was unscathed. 

Overall it took us about 75 minutes to make it from the Leigh Road turnoff to Goldstream. From there is was smooth sailing across the Malahat.

It is with heavy hearts that we announce the closure of Point Ellice House Museum and Gardens, effective immediately.

Our non-profit took over management of the site just a few months before the COVID-19 pandemic began, with a mission to develop and support heritage work that is inclusive, diverse, and representative of communities in the past and present.

Although we were able to successfully weather 3 years of the pandemic and address a significant amount of deferred maintenance at the site, we have been unable to secure sustainable funding for our operations from the Province of BC. In 2021, managers of provincially owned heritage sites wrote to the Province and indicated that without an increase in operational funding, closure would be likely; we have continued to make that point. Unfortunately, that day is now here for Point Ellice House.

We are incredibly proud of the work our staff and volunteers have done to rehabilitate and reinvigorate this special historic site, work that we had hoped could continue. Thank you for your support of our efforts.""

Over the past three years we have done our best to build a sustainable business that delivered from the best restaurants in Victoria, provided the best customer service, and paid our entire staff a fair living wage. As hard as we've tried, it's tough to compete when our prices are much higher than the alternatives. We have built a niche within Victoria's more affluent community who want to eat the best food and don't care how much it costs, but we have been forced to price out the majority of consumers in order to scrape by on small margins.

When we launched The Kitchen we were hoping that we would be able to co-exist with our existing delivery service since we know our customers still love ordering from their favourite restaurants around the city. Unfortunately the logistics of this just didn't make sense and we are now forced to shut down our traditional delivery service to focus on the future of Accio and The Kitchen.

We realize that this will upset some customers, and for that we are sorry. We hope that you will continue to use our service to order from The Kitchen where we not only provide amazing food at an affordable price, but also are able to control the process end to end to make sure your experience is perfect.

An alternative view is the police are being open about what they are seeing.

I tend to think if a police event happens they kind of need to be transparent about it (esp.

Matt mentioned reading the comments on the social media posts which were negative. Well we all know comments sections on social media are a horrible place. Maybe the police can turn off comments which seems reasonable. This way the police can give the public the actual story and the fear comments can't get out of hand.

>RE: Homeless encampment

>Thank you Graeme for outlining the breakdown of Ministries and positions with interest in this property.
>We have received direction (since your previous email) from Stephanie Melvin that the Campers are to be left alone and that they are not asking for any assistance at this time from the VicPD.

>Ms, Melvin confirmed for me that this direction has come directly from ADM Cavanaugh.

>We have communicated our concern to ADM Cavanaugh that things could escalate if allowed to continue on the property without any form of management. We have asked to open a dialogue with her and have offered our assistance in developing a strategy to deal with the current situation and to assist with developing plans moving forward concerning the management of the greenspace as it relates to the homeless population.

>For example, every morning when the VicPD awaken homeless persons in the parks this provides us with opportunities to assess many things such as their exposure level to the elements, mental health status, physical health status, and many other vulnerabilities. We connect them at these times with mental health teams, connect them with housing providers, at times take them to hospital, or call the ambulance if they need immediate medical attention, in addition to that, because they are on City property, the Parks Department comes and deans up accumulated garbage, needles, and human waste. The public works department then hauls all of that away to be disposed of properly.

>Because the space they currently occupy is not on City property none of that management outlined above is happening. In effect, if the people there are allowed to continue to occupy the space, unabated, unrestrained and unmanaged it will be akin to actually creating greater vulnerabilities for them. The likelihood of an assault, overdose, exposure or other incident occurring increases as the population grows without arty form of management.

>One other point that was communicated to ADM Cavanaugh through Ms. Melvin was that there is green space in City Parks available all over the City. The people that are taking shelter on the grounds of the Courthouse are not doing so because there is nowhere for them to go. it is our experienced belief that they are taking up sheltering on that space because they are not being compelled to pack up every morning and move off the grounds.
>As we have communicated our concerns to ADM Cavanaugh in writing the VicPD, respectfully will not be taking any action until we have received a response from her directly.
>May I ask whether there has been communication between the two Ministries you've outlined below with respect to this issue been initiated?

They were driving at the very least at 80km/h in a residential street where the limit is 30. They would have ignored the stop sign if it wasn´t because I was inconveniently in the way. The driver was gorging herself on fries, hands off the wheel, eyes off the road (needed one hand to hold the fries box, another to hold the fries she was punching into her mouth and, of course, in order to do this you need your throat to reach a straight angle, which involves looking at the sky). She wouldn´t have noticed me and slowed down if I hadn´t yelled at her. She stopped and confronted me, even pointing out at one point that she had proudly paid off all her driving tickets (WTF?!). The worst part was when she asked: what are you going to do?

That´s a good question because, unlike many places, BC lacks a system to report people like her and have the police knock on their door when they´ve been reported a few times.

VictoriaBC,rednightmare,"Saanich's Active Transportation Plan Thought /r/VictoriaBC would be interested in Saanich's Active Transportation Plan. This plan was approved by Saanich Council yesterday. ""Active Transportation"" means ""human powered"" so this only covers things like walking, biking, skateboarding, etc. and not plans for road infrastructure. 

You can read a bit about it on [Saanich's Website](http://www.saanich.ca/EN/main/community/getting-around/active-transportation-plan.html). You can also see the full PDF outlining the plan [here](http://www.saanich.ca/assets/Local~Government/Documents/Engineering/Active%20Transportation%20Plan%20FINAL%20(Web\).pdf). You may also want to have a look at the [Official Community Plan](http://www.saanich.ca/EN/main/community/community-planning/official-community-plan-ocp.html), although keep in mind that the OCP is from 2008 and so you'd be reading about things that were already done or are guiding current policy.

The ATP document is pretty long and doesn't outline any specific projects. It's mostly discussion of the background and public consultation process and then an outline of the strategies they are going to pursue. If all you really care about is ""where are the bike lanes going"" then you should jump to page 137 where the first of several maps indicating the priority locations they have identified for adding trails and bike paths. If you are interested in specific projects and plans you should head over to the [Centre & Corridor Plans](http://www.saanich.ca/EN/main/community/community-planning/centre-corridor-plans.html) which outlines more targeted areas and is less broad strokes than what you see in the ATP, including the bike lanes that will be added to Shelbourne in the near future.

One thing that I think will make the anti-bike lane crowd happy is that one of the strategies outlined in the plan is to setup low-cost trial changes. Jump to page 101/102 to see that information, but a rough example of the process for a bike lane would be this:

1. 1 day demonstration: traffic cones used to create a bike lane for a single day for people to experience it.
2. Pilot: temporary lane made with paint and temporary barriers to gauge changes to traffic, overall use and public feedback.
3. Interim: similar to the pilot, but a more permanent solution with the plan to upgrade into a fully separated bike lane complete with new paving and landscaping as a future project.
4. Final: the real deal.

Anyways, go check it out and give it a read. This is going to affect people that live or visit Saanich (so pretty much everyone in Greater Victoria) for the next 30 years. You might as well know what's going on.

VictoriaBC,regalibrary,"Help me find a cozy place to work! Edit: thanks for all the great suggestions, everyone! I've got a list full of places to try now. Much appreciated. 


My entire job is contained on my laptop. I can work anywhere, including the beach, a cafe, the tiny strip of grass my apartment manager calls a backyard, in the car, etc. I don't take calls or make noise; just tap away quietly at the keyboard. I don't have excess supplies, no power cord, no mouse, no sound. Just a little unobtrusive typing. 

What I'm missing is a cozy diner where I can have an occasional working breakfast, sit back, and enjoy a coffee while I'm working. I do frequent a few cafes in the city for this. My two favourites are QV Coffee on Fort street and Koffi on Haultain. Both cafes are super friendly and don't seem to mind me (and my partner) working there for a couple hours together. We always, always buy food and drinks, often more than once during our stay, so the business is making money off the table we occupy. We don't overstay our welcome, we bus our table, and we leave if it starts to get busy. 

I'm assuming most people are against it (can you tell I'm defensive?) but if anyone has suggestions for a cozy diner or small restaurant that wouldn't mind a couple staying to work quietly over breakfast, I'd love to hear 'em! I'm really hoping to find somewhere I can get an actual eggs-toast-hashbrowns kind of breakfast, not just little breakfast sandwiches or pastries. Something more than cafe fare, but definitely traditional breakfast foods. 

I've tried a few places already, including the Oak Bay tea room (at Willows beach), the Dutch bakery & diner downtown, and Christie's pub on Fort, but it wasn't a great fit and I don't want to inconvenience anyone with my work. 

And the backstory: I live in a <500 sq ft. one-bedroom apartment with my husband. It's tiny, it's hot, and sometimes I need a change of scenery. We're self-employed millennials and the city is pretty expensive for us, so we make do with what we have, including little working breakfasts every so often as a treat.

So I'm looking into getting an e-transportation device (e-bike, or scooter), but prefer to buy from a local shop because It was absolute HELL trying to find someone to work on my $2,500 VoltBike e-bike, I ended up spending +$1,000 on fixing it, which didn't really fix everything and had to sell it for the same exact amount (so, a $2,500 loss)..

I really prefer something with a big battery and I just came across this [Super Glide 4.0](https://www.ridetheglide.ca/products/electric-bikes/fat-e-bikes/super-glide-stand-on-bike/) which has a monster couple of batteries at a considerable price, sold, and apparently made right here in Victoria.

VictoriaBC,rhinoscopy_killer,"Living in an RV on private property (with utility hookup, internet, etc) within city - is it feasible? Recently, I started seriously considering living in an RV to save money on living costs as I attend university. I currently live in an apartment with my girlfriend, but if we could potentially save thousands of dollars per year by living in a reasonably-sized RV, I think we could do it. Preferably close-ish to UVIC, where bus transit would be at least feasible. It would have to have water/electricity hookup, and preferably internet hookup.

My main questions are:

* Are there people here who would be willing to rent some driveway/backyard/lot space to park an RV for 4 months to a year or more?

* Is this legal? Even if it's not strictly legal... will anybody do anything about somebody living in an RV, parked knowingly on private property?

* Is this feasible? Would things like heating in the winter, waste disposal, laundry, hot water, lots of power usage (TV, computer, oven, heat), etc be something you could expect to use regularly with such a setup?

* If all else fails, would the local RV parks rent long-term spots for anything like a reasonable price? Are there any RV-suitable locations with hookup that are closer to/within the city?

If a spot like this could be found for something like $200-$300 or even $400 per month to rent (including utility costs), it would save thousands of dollars and make moving an absolute cinch. I have mandatory co-op work in my program, and I will likely have to move out-of-city again the next time I get a job, which can be a huge pain.

Do any of you guys have experience/knowledge with this? Any other tips? Again, I really am seriously considering it. Thanks.

TL;DR: Will anybody in Victoria rent a spot (with electrical/water hookup) long-term for a motor home that I can live in?



**Edit: To provide some more information and questions:**

* I don't currently own an RV, however if I were to buy one, I'd be looking at something a bit newer, maybe in the $30k range, that's in better shape and potentially better insulation properties, etc. I wouldn't want to live in a $2000 beater from 1984.

* I'm looking into pricing for RV parks, but it does not look promising, because they are either too far away to realistically bus every day, or they are so expensive that it doesn't make sense anyway.

* In response to condensation issues raised - can you use a dehumidifier? A space heater? Both? We're still talking about more modern RV's here (think year 2000+)

* Are there any situations where such accommodations can be *shown* to be legal? Some sort of appeal/permit process, perhaps?",Lived Experience,1,False,9.523809523809524

She stomped on the floor above us, and then knocked on my door after peering into our window to confirm it was us that was the source of the talking. I was unable to sleep and my girlfriend was still up at 3am so we started talking again and she immediately started stomping above our heads louder than before. I was speaking quieter than my typical speaking voice. It's like she's hypersensitive to sound and I can't reasonably be any quieter unless I stop speaking entirely. We've been here for 3 nights and I don't feel safe. My anxiety is easily triggered by such stuff. I'm not scared of her but I'm scared about losing my deposit, or being evicted and having nowhere to live. I have sleep issues already and stomping at me in the middle of the night doesn't help. I've rented several places before that would give me a more than positive reference and I've never dealt with such nonsense.

I think she's went through a lot of tenants recently, and there was a craigslist ad advising people away from the place but I foolishly ignored it because I couldn't find anywhere else to live. She claims we're the loudest couple she's ever rented to, and that she can plainly hear us through her headphones every single night since we moved in. Just absurd complaints and I actually see myself as an ideal tenant. Not to mention I can hear her and her every step upstairs, but that's fine with me. That's just part of sharing an older house. 

What should I do? File a complaint with BC tenancy? Ignore her when she knocks on my door and let her make a noise complaint? Deal with it because I probably won't find anywhere else to live? 

Edit: Oh, and she's driving around without a driver's license, so maybe I can use that as leverage for something","BC Housing, Evict, Evicted, Eviction, Our Place, Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program",1,False,7.6923076923076925

VictoriaBC,rocksandgems,"Average Rental Prices Compared to Quality of Rental Hello Reddit Victoria. I am new to town and wanted to understand the rental market a bit better. I found any estimates in the news or online dated and not useful.

So, I analyzed the first 300 rental adds on craigslist that fit the following criteria,

\- Allowed long term rental

\- Had photos of units posted

\- Were located east of Langford and south of central Saanich.

\- Didn't look like scams.

&#x200B;

I assigned each unit a quality rank based off of the photos and details as follows:

1. The unit appears top of the line, clean, modern, or new building (or heritage suite very well cared for. 
2. The unit appears clean and has been renovated to have modern finishings or flooring.
3. The unit appears clean but has dated finishings, might be a basement suite.
4. The unit appears dirty or in need of immediate repair, may have a restriction on the number of tenants, or many be dark/damp.
5. The unit looks like garbage. Add is poorly written or demanding and overly biased.

You probably figured you had enough time to cross the highway from Elk Lake into the left turn lane in the wrong direction of traffic.  Maybe getting onto Piedmont Drive was the closest way home and not riding to the next light would save you 10 minutes. You probably thought that I could see you with the yellow reflective vest you were wearing. There was no way I'd miss you with that bright jacket. You've taken this route so many times - nothing's every gone wrong.

Dearest cyclist, I didn't see you. I didn't see you until you were in front of my car and I braked as hard as I could. I never in a million years thought a cyclist would cycle in front of me out of Elk Lake, cross the highway, and get into the left turn lane for cars try to go the other direction. I've shat bricks before working in the hospitals when something goes terribly wrong with patients. This is probably the hardest brick I've ever shat in my life when we crossed paths. We both know who's going to end up with a brain injury, broken ribs, a dislocated shoulder, a shattered pelvis and a ruptured spleen, probably intubated in the ICU if your bike and my car got into an argument.

Dearest cyclist, I bear you no ill will. I used to cycle from Mayfair to work so I know what it's like. Most people know what's it like - you gauge and estimate and figure you've got enough room or time or space and you go. You push hard on the pedal because you know you can make it by the skin of your teeth. But please, I'm begging you and everyone else out there on the road this season when it's dark early and icy and everyone just wants to get home sooner than later - please just take one more look. Please take just a few more minutes. No one wants to be the reason that another person's ended up in the hospital over the holidays, or worse - ended up in hospital and dying there.

VictoriaBC,rush4life,"House prices come down in Victoria... ""For the first time in two years, the benchmark value of a single-family home in the region and the Victoria core — Victoria, Saanich, Oak Bay, View Royal and Esquimalt — has fallen, according to numbers released Friday by the Victoria Real Estate Board.

The benchmark price, considered a more accurate reflection of housing prices in a given area, dropped to $694,500 in August from $700,800 in July while the benchmark price in the core dropped to $823,100 from $834,200 from the previous month.""

In my own, bias, opinion this is an indicator of a peak in the market which I think/hope will be followed by a drop.  For a significant drop (10%+) to happen I believe 3 things must occur.  The most important of the three is that the b-20 guidelines that OSFI tabled get implemented in full.  This would make it so people with 20% down have to qualify around the same rate as those who don't and ,depending on the exact 5 year rate, would take a mortgage preapproval from someone who qualified at 750K down to around 625K. IMO this would be the biggest factor.  

The next two items that would help is ff the interest rates continue to go up, and the BC gov brings in the speculation tax they talked about I believe we would see easily a 10% correction maybe more.  If you watch the real estate market you would have noted Toronto is down almost 20% in 4 months and while we are vastly different cities it shows its definitely a possibility.

Some background first. I'm a transfer student from India and the University here was abhorrent so I decided to move elsewhere with good and relatively cheap education. I studied two years in India, equivalent to 4 semesters, finished my exams in early June


I originally applied for the Faculty of Engineering under Mechanical Engineering but was rejected as my final transcript hadn't reached by May 30th ( As I was still giving my exams, my final transcript couldn't physically be possible to mail). Anyways, I was told to get my file re-evaluated which they did - to Social Sciences. I would have to begin my degree again and my transfer credit was being done. Yay.

I contacted Engineering office and they helped me register for courses so I could transfer next year to Mechanical Engineering if I had a good enough GPA.


I wanted to ask you guys, how valid is this? Is the transfer thing a bait or will I seriously have a chance to get Engineering based on my GPA. Has anyone got any experience with transferring in UVIC? All other kids from various Universities tell me its really, really hard to transfer faculties.
Can I write a mail to them, asking to transfer me to Engineering since I got my transcript now? Who do I even address the mail to, the acting Dean? Will I have any chances?


Now for the second part, I'll be coming to Canada in mid August and wanted to have a place, what do you folks recommend, how do I go about house hunting? What do I even look for?

I am not someone who seeks out paranormal stuff in particular and don't really believe in these things unless proven by science. They were strange enough that I can't explain them and it might be fun to hear about your experiences too. 

I lived in James bay for a number of years and worked at a group home for those with disabilities. My shifts were 3-11. I had a hard time hitting the hay as soon as I got home so would find ways to unwind to get ready for bed. One of those was painting. I was painting one evening after work, listening to music and just enjoying myself. The next thing i know I am coming to. Like back to being conscious. I feel a huge rush of energy from my toes rush up and through my head. I had a rabbit at the time and he ran out from under the bed and was thumping his back feet over and over. I had no idea what just happened to me. I have never felt anything like it. I have no health conditions and don't ever black out so I still can't explain what happened that evening. But my rabbit and I both experienced it. 

At another house in James Bay where I lived, my roommates cat would follow something in the air constantly. Like stalk it. Its eyes would be darting around up in the air like it saw something. It would freak me out as I didn't see a bug or anything it could be watching. Trust me I was checking! 

Other weird and somewhat magical occurrences also happened when I lived there. Or maybe they are just really easily explained but I have never experienced them other than when I lived in James bay.

I went to a couple stores and they were all $4000-$6000! I'm basically poverty level so I was wondering if it's going to be impossible to find a cargo bike in store for $2500-$3000? With what I have saved and the ebike rebate that is all i can afford. I see rad runner is on the lower end. Does anyone know if there are ebike stores in town that carry them or lower end alternatives? I have my little ones with me so dragging them to every store makes things difficult as they have little patience for it. Thanks in advance for any tips!,Poverty,1,False,54.54545454545454
VictoriaBC,sasquatchv,"School Bus Question on Saanich Peninsula Hi,

We are thinking of buying a house that is near Elk Lake and would be in the Prospect Lake Elementary and Royal Oak Middle catchments.

We want our kids to go to French Immersion, so they would need to go ""out of catchment"" to Keating Elementary and Bayside Middle.

Our home address will be on Old West Saanich Rd about 6 and 8 kms away from those two French immersion schools.

**My question is - how likely are we to be able to get bus service?**

I read on the SD63 website that ""program of choice"" students (ie French immersion student) are not guaranteed bus service if they live out of catchment.

**Does anyone have experience with how likely or unlikely we would be to get bus service?**

This is the maintenance schedule for 2nd service
http://imgur.com/a/4TrYe

I don't want to go to hyundai dealership because they seem to be overcharging. I went to Victoria hyundai dealership for 1st maintenance and ended up paying 100$. They told me that they will change engine oil. After reading manual, I realized that my car didn't even need a engine oil change as I had just 3800kms on the odometer. Also, they told me that they will be using castrol engine oil which is expensive(Hyundai booklet recommends quaker slat engine oil which is quite cheap). They also tried to sell me a vip oil change program which covers oil changes for 2 years for 300$.

Hence, I am looking for a alternative place for car maintenance. I am not looking to do oil changes and inspections myself. I am looking for a place which is reliable and doesn't try to overcharge/upsell.

VictoriaBC,saynothingever,"Just doing some reading on Projects with in Victoria and found this. (with TLDR) I was reading over some stuff on city projects and how they are being funded. I have a bit of an interest given that the city is spending a wild amount of money on a lot of projects and not giving moneys to the police etc  when it is requested , Money is not available for homeless issues, taxes have gone up and so on. I am concerned with the spending happening with in the city. I agree some of the projects are good but not on the scale they are being done on. The bills will have to be paid at some point. this will happen through taxes or fees forced on the public. This project is one of the biggest ones the city has done to date  followed with one of the most controversial and arguably unneeded (bike lanes) and the bike lanes are being done at the complete whim and wants of the very few on City Counsel. Now before you get your pitch forks out I do think the city could benefit from bike lanes in one shape or another but not at the projected costs that are being looked at. I mean Ben Isitt already spent half a million dollars on plans for Cook street with out looking at the Viability of it. They have already planned out the bike lanes on Dallas road with out releasing them to the public. the plans are to narrow the road to a two laner and remove the majority of parking so far.

Read the 2nd to last paragraph of the project description. 
Why is the CRD WWTP project paying for the bike lanes?
https://www.crd.bc.ca/about/contracts-rfps/Current/rfq-cfm-100-clover-forcemain 

So what does this all mean you ask. It means that the city is tagging on bike lanes to much larger projects to shield them from the publics ability to have design input or decline paying for them. This will add several million dollars to this project alone. 

(Tldr) The city has removed the need to ask for public approval, cost approval or input to major projects by tagging them on to other projects thus acting independently from their mandated jobs","Community Plan to End Homelessness , Homeless",1,True,0.0

March 14, 8:15 PM

 

Finishing the semester and ensuring students can continue their program – Camosun College is open, transitioning to alternative delivery

 

Update from President Sherri Bell

 

Thank you for your patience and understanding during a very challenging and complex time. Camosun College continues to monitor the COVID-19 situation and is taking measures to keep students and employees safe.

 

Camosun’s COVID-19 Response Coordination Team and Deans met today to discuss additional measures on how we can maintain social distancing on campus to minimize close contact with each other. We continue to align with the guidance from the Provincial Health Officer and are working with the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. At the same time, we want to ensure students can continue their education or training and complete the winter semester.

 

Camosun will be transitioning from face-to-face instruction to alternative instruction and assessment as part of measures to support social distancing. Instructors will be in direct contact with students regarding transition and be available on campus on Monday.

 

It will take time to transition. Transition will look different for each instructor based on what they teach and learning outcomes need to be met. With more than 160 different programs, hundreds of Continuing Education courses and programs that are not on the semester system that all use a variety of instructional formats, a single approach to completion of courses and exams would not be appropriate.

 

Instructors are asked to plan the most appropriate alternative delivery method and assessment for their students using their own professional judgement. Instructors are also asked to communicate their plans for completing courses and assessment to their students as soon as possible and to their department chair by Friday, March 20, 2020.

 

Instructors can choose how to best deliver their courses such as email and/or tools from Camosun’s eLearning capabilities including:

·   D2L to post content, upload video or audio.

·   Collaborate Web Conferencing to meet with students virtually in real time.

·   Kaltura video streaming to create and post videos to D2L.

 

To assess whether learning outcomes have been met, during this time, instructors can do the following, while ensuring consistency across courses:

·   Change the weighting of assignments or tests to determine a final grade.

·   Assess remaining assignments that do not require in-person delivery or attendance.

·   Add a new assessment component.

·   Determine a different way of assessment to an in-person final exam.

 

The Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning has published Guidance for Remote Instruction.

 

The new measures apply to all programs including continuing education courses and will be in effect until April 24, which is also the end of the winter examination period. This date is subject to review.

 

College services and supports

 

The college campus, services and supports will remain open and available to students, while taking measures to support social distancing. We realize that this is a very stressful time for many students and employees. Regular supports are still up and running such as counselling and access to computers at the library to name a few. All the services that students count on remain available.

 

The Centre for Accessible Learning can assist with providing services and educational accommodations for students with a diagnosed disability.

 

We know that these new instruction and assessment measures will require some adjustments for students, staff, deans, chairs and instructors. Thank you to everyone in our college community for your ongoing cooperation, flexibility and understanding. We can get through this by working together. Our focus remains on the health and safety of our community and ensuring our students succeed.

 

The most current information and FAQs for students, employees and campus visitors are posted and regularly updated on the college website at camosun.ca/covid19

Women Warriors Needed for Topless Hot Yoga in Victoria Tomorrow (thursday) night at 7:30 pm short version:friend invited me to hot yoga. $10 for a week of unlimited yoga. Went first day, afterwards washed sweaty clothing. Went again for yoga today for a more difficult class than the class I went to the day before. My yoga bra was still wet at home so I just wore a shirt. Got into the yoga room it was much hotter than the previous yoga the day before. I was like I cannot do this in a shirt way too hot. See all these shirtless guys. I go to the front desk and ask if I can do it topless, was told that I could and even got a laugh and they were amused by the request. I do its all good.  Survive yoga. Afterwards I am told that me being topless is a distraction to others and I need to cover up next time I come. I ask if she saw anyone being distracted said that its not common and people did a few looks. I did not press the issue.

I ponder issue.Think FUCK THAT!ITs not on me for other people to not sexualize my bodyI find other peoples boners, abs and tattoos are distracting but it's on the individual to not sexualize people not to shame women.

This is not equality.Will talk with the owner tomorrow I did not make an issue of it today just not right time and place.SO my plan is to talk to them tomorrow, then have another woman or two that also want to do topless yoga with me for support.Its about the principle.

Another person would be helpful, also its a bit nerve wracking for me so some support would be good. Afterwards the ladies in the change room actually thanked me for my courage for going topless, when I was really just going to be way to hot and my other top was dirty at home. But I don't like being told that I am a distraction and its my responsibility to hide my body for other people and it also implies that others are incapable of actually controlling themselves.

Please reply or message me ASAP if your down to join on my topless yoga!

UPDATE!

Emailed owner, wrote email detailing situation and my views of the ethics of the situation. Requested to attend class again tonight with the same rights as a man, to go shirtless. They got back to me and said that their 'private policy which is NOT listed on their site or yoga etiquette stating that their dress code requires women to wear shirts. Offered e a refund and said that I could not go the class.

As such, looking for people who are interested in doing a all gender topless yoga class! Taking names and kicking ass. Message me if you want to be on the list.

* Hiking/MTB trails

>Hi robot! Let's have some fun. Could you describe the different neighbourhoods of Victoria, BC, Canada in a honest but humorous way?

Sure, let's embark on a humorous journey through the neighborhoods of Victoria, BC, Canada:

1. **James Bay:** Where retirees live their dream of having a garden gnome on every inch of their property. This is the district where ""going for a walk"" might mean an amble along the waterfront, or a two-week cruise to Alaska.
2. **Fairfield:** Fairfield is home to people who would rather cycle up a hill in the rain than drive in a car. This neighbourhood is essentially an ongoing contest to see who can grow the most kale in their front yard.
3. **Fernwood:** Coffee shops and yoga studios galore, Fernwood is the place for people who have gluten allergies, yet mysteriously only when eating bread, not beer. Also known as the land where you can't swing a reusable grocery bag without hitting an artist.
4. **Oak Bay:** Where even the deer are too posh to eat your roses. You'll find more British accents here than in Britain. Lawn bowling is a blood sport.
5. **Rockland:** Where the houses are grand, the trees are ancient, and the ghosts are Victorian-era politicians. Might be the setting for the next big gothic horror novel.
6. **Downtown:** Forget fitness clubs. Here, you’ll get all the exercise you need by repeatedly circling the block looking for parking. The aroma of the sea, food trucks, and weed all combine to create that signature Downtown Victoria smell.
7. **Chinatown:** Dragons. Lanterns. Dim Sum. Need I say more? No, seriously, that’s about it.
8. **Harris Green:** Known for having the only 24-hour grocery store in town. The closest thing Victoria has to ""the city that never sleeps,"" if by ""never sleeps,"" you mean ""stays up late to eat organic vegan ice cream.""
9. **Esquimalt:** It's like living in a maritime postcard: sea views, Navy base, and enough seagulls to make you reconsider your desire to eat fries outdoors.
10. **Vic West:** The place that assures mainlanders that they indeed left Vancouver. A beautiful mix of shipping docks, townhouses, and puzzled faces asking, ""Where exactly is the downtown?""

Remember, this is all in good fun! Victoria is a beautiful city with diverse and vibrant neighborhoods. Each one offers a unique lifestyle and vibe, making Victoria a great place to live and explore.

Let's try to change that.

EDIT: I understand that my post has come off as hostile towards an entire generation. I want to acknowledge that the housing issues we have are entirely the result of it being treated as a for-profit commodity, and not because older people are intentionally trying to sabotage my life. That said, it's hard not to notice that basically everyone who showed up to City Hall to kill MMHI had grey hair.

I also want to extend my thanks to the older folks who *do support* making this city more affordable for people like me, so my apologies for throwing you under the bus.","Affordable, Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, People with lived experience, Victoria Women in Need",1,True,0.0

Langford Mayor Stew Young’s salary will double and his councillors’ pay will increase by more than 55 per cent under a new remuneration policy endorsed by councillors.

The mayor’s annual salary will increase to $75,863 from $37,558 while annual remuneration for councillors will increase to $27,410 from $17,661 retroactive to Jan. 1.

At Young’s request, the policy states the mayor’s increase can be phased in over a period of between two and five years.

“I don’t like it,” Young said of the size of increase. “They were going to do it all in one year and I  said, ‘That will not happen.’ ”

Young said he will take his increase over five years.

Langford councillors have not had a raise in 13 years and their salaries have fallen way behind other municipalities of similar size — a situation exacerbated by the municipality’s rapid growth, says a staff report.

“There’s a lot of catching up to do,” said Coun. Lillian Szpak.

The new council remuneration rates represent the low end of the average of council salaries of similar-sized communities [excluding those in Metro Vancouver] in the province,” Szpak said.

“We are the lowest on average. So we’re very mindful of our taxpayer. We’re very mindful of making sure that we are keeping costs low for our community.”

“On one hand it’s hard for councils to say we’re going to be giving ourselves a raise but you’re the only people that can because you’re the decision makers and you have to look to the future as well. And you don’t want to be having a great big lump sum jump. This is where we’ve ended up because we’ve left it all this time,” Szpak said.

Young said that the under the city’s bylaw, council remuneration should have been reviewed every two years and it was “a mistake” that it was not.

He said his council is deserving of the raise but he doesn’t like the optics of the large increase.

“Langford has a culture of keep our costs down and ... unfortunately we kept it down a little bit too much,” Young said. “We should have kept with the plan of [reviewing it] every two years and we wouldn’t be doing this.”

Given Langford’s population of 39,368, its councillors are being paid 45 cents per capita. That is considerably less than similar size municipalities, says the report.

For example in North Cowichan (population 29,676) councillors are paid 97 cents per capita for $28,782 a year.

In Port Moody (population 33,551) councillors are paid $1.21 per capita for $40,579.

In Mission (population 38,833) councillors are paid $1.09 per capita for $42,197 a year.

Young’s current remuneration equates to 95 cents per capita for $37,558.

By comparison, North Cowichan Mayor Al Siebring receives $2.69 per capita for $79,956.

Port Moody Mayor Rob Vagramov receives $3.33 per capita for $111,833.

Mission Mayor Pam Alexis is paid $2.17 per capita for $84,394.

The recommended remuneration was set at the average of five similar-sized municipalities. The newly adopted salaries reflect a council salary of 70 cents per capita and the mayor receiving $1.93 per capita.

Councillors and their families are also to receive extended health and dental benefits.

Extra pay of for councillors serving as acting mayor will be capped at the current $828 per month.",Community Plan to End Homelessness ,0,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,shakakoz,"Victoria eyes forever rentals, but landlords say no way https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/victoria-eyes-forever-rentals-but-landlords-say-no-way-1.23876766

A sweeping zoning change under consideration by Victoria council to ensure purpose-built rental buildings remain rental is being met with dismay by landlords and the development community

“This is a non-starter,” said David Hutniak, CEO of Landlord B.C.

“This is a down-zoning. Some of our members call it expropriation.”

Victoria councillors decided Thursday to begin consulting with building owners and the public on plans to apply residential rental tenure zoning to all 500 existing purpose-built rental buildings — containing about 16,000 apartment units — in the city.

If approved, the change would mean only residential rental units would be permitted on the properties — even if they were redeveloped.

It’s a move that’s needed in a city where 61 per cent of residents are renters, said Mayor Lisa Helps.

“We are going to need this amount of rental housing in the city in perpetuity without question. I don’t doubt that. So from that point of view alone, this is a sound direction to go,” Helps said.

But Hutniak said what is being proposed by Victoria is contrary to what the province intended when it gave municipalities authority to designate rental tenure zones last year. And, he said, it devalues the properties.

“These properties have been assessed by B.C. Assessment for many, many years on the basis of highest and best use. We’ve been paying property taxes on the basis of highest and best use. Do you know what highest and best use is for these properties? It’s condos. It’s not purpose-built rentals. So are we going to get a tax rebate for decades back?” Hutniak said.

Coun. Ben Isitt called for a “streamlined” approach to consultation.

“I think recognizing that we’re going to be far from, I think, unanimous support in the community for this approach. So ideally, not consuming too much staff resources, if possible, between now and [when] it comes to a more formal public hearing process would be my preference,” Isitt said.

Helps said Victoria is not alone in moving toward the zoning change, noting Burnaby, New Westminster and Squamish all have made or are planning similar changes.

City staff note that 96 per cent of the 500 rental properties in the city were built prior to 1980.

Most of the older properties are likely in need of significant improvements and thus could be candidates for redevelopment.

Hutniak said the “harsh reality” is that the vast majority of Victoria’s rental stock is old and “beyond its functional life.”

“So we need to look at progressive solutions here — work with the owners of these buildings, work with the developers of rental housing.

“What was contemplated here or discussed in the early stages of this report is a non-starter, frankly,” he said.

Jordan Milne, board chairman of the Urban Development Institute, said the city’s proposal could jeopardize property owners’ ability to get financing to maintain buildings.

He said building owners should be given the opportunity to opt into rental tenancy zoning and provided incentives to do so.

“It’s really difficult to make rental work. You can’t pay the same for land to build rental as you can to build condos.”

Consideration should also be given to using zoning to encourage rental development in areas where the city wants to see rentals built, he said.

“It takes a huge risk out of the process for a rental developer and it levels the playing field for a rental developer when considering buying a site versus a condo developer. [It provides] better certainty, shorter time frame, lower risk and for the city, it really encourages the kind of tenure they want to see,” Milne said.

Milne said the new zoning should “absolutely not” be imposed without the owners’ consent.

City staff have been directed to solicit public feedback through September and October and report to council in November. Rezoning proceedings could then begin if council chooses to go ahead.

Staff say rezoning of the 500 properties could be done in three batches, starting with the oldest properties.","Community Plan to End Homelessness , Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, Peers Victoria Resources Society , Point in Time, Victoria Women in Need",1,True,0.0

I currently am renting a house in Victoria with my husband and the kitchen has a lovely stainless steel glass top stove with double oven. it was by no means new when we started renting a few months ago, but it wasn't it horrible shape eiher. 

A few days ago, i was making iced tea in a glass pitcher, and the lid slid off and hit the glass top, chipping the middle of a burner and cracking that whole corner, making that burner and probably one other unusable (and yet somehow the lid didn't break...).

We told our landlord about it and that we get the top replaced but after looking into it, we've found that it is discontinued (the stove is at least 10 years old). To replace the whole thing is about $2000, which we really can't afford. Are we required to replace the whole stove brand new? Or can we put in a cheaper one? Or a used one? I'm not really sure what to do.

Edit: For the record the iced tea was on the counter, the lid slid off and hit the stove. I wasn't using the stove as a counter. 

Also, people seem to be under the impression that we are dicks. We are trying to do the right thing here, we just can't afford a $2000 stove. I know it's my fault, and want to find the best result possible.","Affordable Housing, Affordable housing ",1,False,0.0

Reconciliation with Indigenous communities is an important undertaking in Canada today. What reconciliation looks like, and how we build trust in order to move forward to create a future of equal opportunity and respect, is an uncharted journey guided largely by respect and a willingness to listen, to learn and to try.

To take action on reconciliation, city council created the city family, a group of Indigenous and non-Indigenous members appointed in June 2017. The city family is a body of council and reports to council.

When city council voted to endorse the city family’s decision to relocate the statue of Sir John A. Macdonald from the steps of city hall and expressed a desire to work with the community to find a more appropriate public space for it, I knew that council had made the right decision. And I still think that today.

But now that I have had time to reflect on the process, I feel the need to explain some things that have weighed heavily on my mind.

As mayor of Victoria, I apologize for not recognizing that the city family’s process might make some people feel excluded from such an important decision. I didn’t recognize the great desire of Victoria residents to participate in reconciliation actions. The process going forward will enable this.

Reconciliation means following Indigenous leadership. It means listening carefully to how symbols and monuments that might be meaningful to many can create barriers for others. And it also means being in dialogue, and creating opportunities for true learning and conversation among Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities. But it is complex, and so we will make mistakes as we navigate and try to walk this road together.

I made a public commitment to bring the wishes of council and the public for a wider community conversation about reconciliation and a new location for the statue to the city family. I will do this. I have also arranged a meeting with the John A. Macdonald Society and invited the statue’s sculptor, John Dann. These conversations are also important steps in the reconciliation process.

I do not speak for the whole city family — I am but one member — but I can explain from my point of view why the statue needed to be removed from the steps of city hall even though we had not yet selected a site to publicly relocate it.

This action was not, as many news articles have suggested, a symbolic or empty gesture. The statue in its original location was a barrier to Indigenous communities’ engagement with city hall. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission calls upon all levels of government to engage with Indigenous Peoples on reconciliation action. Without relocating the statue, we were not able to invite First Nations to city hall in good faith and respect.

Reconciliation needs to take place in the real world, not just in our hearts.

Macdonald shaped one of the greatest nations and strongest democracies in the world. When we look around the world today, we have a lot to be thankful for. Moving the statue does not erase this history.

The statue’s relocation to a more appropriate public place — and all the conversations that have taken place and will continue to take place — only serve to broaden our understanding of Canadian history.

It’s time to move forward together.

As we work through the process of reconciliation as a community, with the Songhees and Esquimalt Nations on whose homeland the city was built, we have the opportunity to create a more welcoming, inclusive city for everyone. And this is something I’ve heard loud and clear that all Victorians value.

VictoriaBC,sideways8,"Together Victoria nominates Stefanie Hardman to run in Victoria council byelection More than 400 members of Together Victoria voted Sunday to nominate Stefanie Hardman to run as a candidate for city council in a byelection expected in April.

“By voting for me, you have voted to do politics differently, together,” said Hardman, who came to the podium to cheers of her name after the results were announced.

Hardman works as a community-based researcher and planner, which she said means she has spent a lot of time listening to people about their concerns.

“I’ve worked with renters. I’ve worked with people experiencing homelessness. I’ve worked with some of the lowest paid and most poorly protected workers in Victoria — retail, food service and hospitality workers — and I’ve heard their concerns and their ideas for what could improve their lives,” Hardman said.

The nomination meeting was open only to registered members of the group, which has grown to more than 800 people. Hardman was one of eight names on the ballot.

Councillors Sarah Potts and Sharmarke Dubow, the slate’s current city councillors, did not attend the nomination meeting, but Laurel Collins, whose successful NDP campaign to represent Victoria federally triggered the byelection, was there to cast a ballot.
Collins said it was exciting to see such a large turnout from the group, which had about 200 members when she ran for city council in 2018.

“The organization has grown exponentially. It’s amazing,” Collins said.

Co-chair Ashley McKay said the growth of the group shows that Together Victoria’s values of affordability and inclusivity resonate with residents. “It really shows the community that these values are important.”

City council endorsed a scaled-down approach to the byelection last month, cutting the number of election-day voting stations and limiting communications to residents informing them of the byelection, in order to save money and staff time.

City staff have estimated the byelection will cost between $140,000 to $170,000, as opposed to $320,000 to $360,000 for a standard election process.

A date for the byelection has not been set.

Jeremy Caradonna, a policy analyst in the provincial government’s Climate Action Secretariat, is running for the council seat.

Kari Sloane, who works for B.C. Emergency Health Services, has also indicated her intention to run.

Here's an article written about what's happening as well as additional follow-up and details regarding the email and who may be involved.

\---------------------

&#x200B;

VIVA and/or VIVA supporters have sent an email out to local preschools and daycares pretending to be Island Health endorsing VIVA candidates.  Here is the email:

Subject: Upcoming Municipal ElectionsDate: Mon, 3 Oct 2022 00:29:33 -0700From: Director Child Care Services [islandhealthbc@gmail.com](mailto:islandhealthbc@gmail.com)To: Director Child Care Services [islandhealthbc@gmail.com](mailto:islandhealthbc@gmail.com)

>Hello Victoria and Area Daycares,As most  of you are aware, municipal elections for mayor and council, as well as  for trustees for school district 61 are being held on Saturday, October  15, 2022. There are also opportunities for advance voting on October  5th, 7th, 11th and 12th. You can contact the City of Victoria for  specific times and locations.There are many  candidates running and we understand it may be a daunting task to sift  through all the information to determine which are the best candidates,  representing views which align with those of us in the field of child  care.Therefore, we have a list of recommended  candidates who share our values of providing a fair and inclusive  learning environment, while promoting academic excellence for students  in the schools. Also included in the list are councillors running to  make Victoria streets safer and more accessible with a focus on expanded  mental health supports for those impacted by drug addiction and  homelessness.We endorse the following candidates:MayorStephen AndrewCouncillorsJulia Alvarez\*Sandy Janzen\*Jason Jones\*Muller Kalala\*Jeremy Maddock\*Dr. Emmanuel Parenteau\*Jordan QuitzauBrad Sifert\*TrusteesSalvetina Agba\*Leslie-Anne Goodall\*Janice Novotill\*Roberta Solvey\*Oliver Wu\*Sasha Zhang\*Judith ZuluAll  candidates with an asterix beside their name have been endorsed by the  Vancouver Island Voter's Association as well and will say, endorsed by  VIVA right on the ballot, so this will assist at the ballot box.Don't forget to get out and vote for better schools and a better city for our kids!Island Health BC

I have forwarded this email to all other candidates not listed in this email, media outlets and related government bodies.  Here is my email:

>This email is being sent to Island Health, the Ministry of Children and  Families, Elections Canada, Elections BC, various local media agencies  and all other candidates relating to this election NOT listed in the  email below.

>Today I received the email forwarded below from an email address called  ""[islandhealthbc@gmail.com](mailto:islandhealthbc@gmail.com)"" pretending to be Island Health and  specifically endorsing all candidates in the City of Victoria and SD61 that are part of the VIVA Victoria slate.  This slate is endorsed by the  far right-wing People's Party of Canada.  Given that the election is  just around the corner many voters are looking to find endorsements from  reputable organizations.  **The fact that this political party is  pretending to be a reputable government body and endorsing its  candidates is unacceptable and unethical at best and illegal at worst.**  
>  
>Given the formatting of my email in the subject line it leads me to  believe that the emails were either sourced internally through someone  from the Ministry of Children and Families or pulled from a list of  emails relating to BC daycares and preschools publicly found on the Government of  BC's website:  \*website link redacted for privacy\*  
>  
>I work with many local daycares and preschools and receive regular  communication from the Ministry of Children and Families and Island  Health.  At first I was shocked to see that Island Health officially  endorsed candidates and even more shocked that this email specifically  mentioned the VIVA slate which other local non-government groups have  warned AGAINST.  Given my skepticism I noticed the email address it was  sent from and searched to find where they received MY email address from  as it is not publicly listed.  Many voters are looking for guidance in  these elections and consider endorsements seriously - many people who  received this email may believe it's coming from a legitimate source and  may vote in their favour.   
>  
>**I think that it is crucial that Island Health and the Ministry of  Children and Families send out an email to all contacts in their mailing  lists informing them that they are not endorsing any candidates.  I  also think that it is crucial to get the word out to all voters through  media about this unethical practice from VIVA and/or VIVA supporters.**

>I urge you to publicly respond to this unethical act.  Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

This kind of act goes completely against what democracy stands for and is manipulating voters who are looking for guidance.

VictoriaBC,slothernaught,"Cheap Wedding Venues Ideas Hey, 

I think what I'm looking for is impossible but maybe someone knows of a hidden Gem. 

I am getting married in a month, we are eloping and just doing a justice of the peace with our two witnesses. No family or friends. We wanted to have a wedding reception/party next summer. The problem is we have to have it for under $4k. The entire reason we are eloping is because we knew a wedding would be out of the question. I was hoping since we were cutting out a bunch of things that we could just throw a party for 50 people under that amount. 

I wanted to have a potluck event to save money on catering. So then we would just need to pay for the space, photographer, and alcohol. The problem is most venues won't let you bring in outside food and force you to use a caterer. I priced out catering and even with just doing appetizers they come to around $2,000-$3,500 which does not leave much room for anything else. 

I have contacted these venues:
-The Gardens at the hpc (starts at $3,000)
-Goward House
-Abkhazi gardens
-Sea cidery
-Art Gallery 
-Swans

The only thing I want from a space is room to dance and some kind of outdoor space for photographs. I'm feeling a bit like we have no options, and the options we do have are pretty ugly. I'd rather wait a few years to have a party then have it in some dingy community hall now. Any idea's or help would be amazing, I just want to have some drinks and dance with all the people I love!

His latest shenanigan is that he gets up between 11pm and 5am; both randomly and sometimes multiple times a night, to get on his motorcycle (sort of like a Harley, but I'm not a big motorcycle guy) and just revs the engine for 5-10 minutes at a time. This 100% intentional because he typically backs it up right up the driveway near his landlords front door, and just let's loose. He doesn't drive off or anything, he reparks it and goes back inside.

We've gone to Whistler several times, but this year I'm going to visit UVic so it would be nice to explore the local mountains.

It also seems much cheaper in Mt Washington in terms of passes, lessons, rentals etc, and I'm excited for the night skiing option as well. Anyway, I have a few questions, thanks in advance to anyone who answers them!

1. What's the snow quality like on Mt Washington? Is there going to be more/less snow next year? I heard this year had lots of good snow.

2. Anything to do besides snowsports? Like any parks, waterfalls, spas etc, maybe some tourist attractions etc to go to? (i need my parents to not stay indoors every day)

3. How affordable is the housing? I've read that there's some mountainside places to go to about 120+ per night, and there's a bus that runs from somewhere to the mountain every day?

4. Any opinions on the ski/snowboard school? I'm an intermediate snowboarder but I still plan to take lessons.

5. Any recommended trails, nice places to go to, restaurants etc? 

6. Any warnings about anything? Too touristy, avalanches, too many people etc.

7. How's the highway conditions during late February? I don't think it'll be too difficult providing all the regular safety measures are implemented etc...is that true?

If the city wants to progress with amalgamation, then wards would help alleviate concerns that some neighbourhoods would be forgotten. It would be easier for candidates to gain name recognition through community actions and run against a smaller field on the ballot.

I self represented and won. She lied to everyone about me. She said I told her I had a murderer in my head and I didnt know when it would get out an hurt someone. She said I told her I had a bunch of mental illnesses that I didnt have.

 It took three years from first incident to trial decision.

VictoriaBC,sparticis,"Defund Police V. Increased Health Care I am genuinely curious to hear the thoughts of those in the ""defund/abolish/dissolve police"" camp. Full disclosure: I am in the criminal justice system, but I would like to have a productive conversation about this.

I have watched the situation down in the States and know the governing system is very different than it is in Canada. So it confuses me to see Canadians demand for police to be defunded based on the argument that those funds be used for increased mental health/addiction support. 

In Canada, health care is a provincial responsibility. Policing is, generally, a municipal cost. The provinces are not gaining any funds if policing costs are cut at a municipal level. 

**So why is there such a push to defund the police when we should ALL (police, doctors, lawyers, the general public) be coming together to lobby the province to allocate more resources toward treatment/recovery, support, and mental health services?**

I am all for police not going to ""check well-being"" calls if there is no tenor of violence. Even then, police should be background activities for health care professionals. Hell, police do not want to be going to those calls anyways. 

When provinces pay for health-care, it will ease the demand on police. Police budgets will go down as they won't be doing the province's job free of charge.

I'm a fairly introverted guy, so the closure of pubs and restaurants isn't bothering me too much.  The closure of some of the parks however has been upsetting.  Typically I'm fairly resilient, and my luck that I still have employment and the routine that goes with that really helps to keep me a little disconnected from what's happening around me.  Still, work is quiet, many of my coworkers are working from home and the remainder are keeping good physical distancing.  There's a clearly something missing.  

I've only just been able to find some clarity after parting ways with someone I was becoming very close too at the end of August.  On the verge of getting back out to make some new connections, the COVID shutdown hit.  The lack of energy, just the reduction in traffic near home has become a deafening silence.  Aside from seeing a friend or two throughout the week, I normally like keep to myself but the inability to make new connections has amplified a sense of isolation like I haven't felt before.  Victoria is a place where it seems like everyone knows everyone; 6 degrees of separation is more like 3 here, but now we're all giving everyone space like we're all carrying the plague.

VictoriaBC,starwarslunchbox,"Camping by Bicycle Hello, 

I’m sorry if this is the wrong forum or an often asked question. My wife and I are planning on coming up from Portland to visit her little brother in Sooke, and we were hoping to do a cycling/camping trip while up there. The plan is to arrive by ferry with our bikes in Victoria and cycle the Galloping Goose Trail to Sooke Potholes Regional Park and camp at the Spring Salmon Place campground. The park looks beautiful, but I’ve read that it can get busy. Would we have trouble finding a camping site if we rolled up on a Thursday or Friday afternoon? We’ll be arriving the 12th or 13th of July. 

Are there any alternatives to Sooke Potholes? I see that the trail runs through some parks but it doesn’t look like there is much in the way of camping at any of them. 

Thanks for reading. 

Edit:  Thanks for all your responses. This is all really helpful information. If you ever have a question about Portland send me a line, I’ll try to help. 

Post Trip Update: Thought I’d give an update after the trip for anyone who might be looking through the subreddit for similar information in the future. 

First off thanks to everyone who responded. The trip was amazing and your information really helped us sort everything out. 

For those coming from the US, the Port Angeles ferry is great. It’s cheap, a short ride, they have long term parking if you’re doing an overnight, and we even saw a ton of whales on the ride over. Once you’re in Victoria the ride through town to the Goose trail is easy. Compared to Portland Downtown Victoria is an amazing place to have a bike (at least the bit of it I saw). They have separated bike ways through town and it shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes to get to the trail itself. Just take it slow and make sure to stop for pedestrians. 

For the first 15km or so there are plenty of water stations and bathrooms. The trail is paved and easy with virtually no hills to climb. Once the trail turns to gravel you’ll be approaching some safe but slightly confusing highway crossings. Keep your eye out for the signs and follow everyone else on bikes. After that you’re on your own for water. Still basically no hills anywhere on the trip. A friend of ours joined us and took his road bike with skinny tires and he had no problem the whole way. 

On your approach to Matheson Lake, make sure to keep your eye out for Rocky Point Road. Take a left (if coming from Victoria) and immediately look for the Glenrosa Restaurant. It’s open from 10-4 Thursday through Sunday and is worth a stop. Just as a note, I think the trail crosses Rocky Point road twice. The restaurant is just a few steps from the trail (you can probably see it from the trial) however so if you don’t see it immediately get back on the trail and go to the next crossing. 

The rest of the ride is where the scenery really begins to force you off the bike. You’re going to encounter a lot of beautiful sites, stop for all of them. Swim in the lake. Enjoy the forest. Take pictures of the coast. 

Once you’re in Sooke the ride up to the Potholes is still pretty easy. The only difficulty right now is that the Todd Creek Trestle is under repair and the bypass is not suitable for bike riding. You can get away with it at some points, but there is one hill that will be tough to get your bike and gear all the way up. You’ll probably have to get off the bike and remove the gear. Much easier for groups than single riders. You can also take the road up to the campground, but it isn’t nearly as pleasant. 

The camp ground will definitely find room for you if there are no campsites available. If you have a bunch of people in your group it might get a bit crowded, but it’s not too bad. 

Sooke itself is wonderful. Biking in on the highway is not as secluded or easy as the Goose, but it isn’t too difficult either. Plenty of restaurants and stores for supplies if you didn’t bring any food along. I recommend the Sooke Brewing Company as well, we had a couple nice nights there. They don’t serve food but might have a food cart outside and will allow you to bring in any food you want. There’s also a good bike shop in town if you need some repairs. 

All in all it was a great trip and we are absolutely going to do it again. 

tl;dr:

1)Stop for pedestrians in Victoria. You’re not in a rush. 

2) Water for the first 15km. 

3) Go for lunch at the Glenrosa Restaurant on Rocky Point Road Thursday-Sunday. 

4) Make sure the Todd Creek Trestle is open. The bypass around the trestle is doable but will require you pushing your gear and bike up a short but steep hill. 

5) The campground has room for you. 

6) Go to Sooke Brewing Company.

I'll be updating this page for the next 6 weeks or so - usually the season ends mid-August.

If you know of other farms or have more up-to-date info and corrections, please add the info in your comments and I will add it to the main post. I know mostly of the farms in the Saanich area, but other close to Victoria areas are welcome too. Thank you.

The main difference from last year is that you are not to bring your own containers due to COVID concerns.

In BC, the blueberry varieties that are mainly grown for commercial production are Duke, Reka, Bluecrop, Brigitta, Liberty and Elliott. Some of them produce huge berries, some small. Some of them are sweet, while others are tart. some of them are very juice, while others are more on a dry side.

**Please make sure to check farmer's Facebook page before going, as sometimes they close for a day or two - and most of the time they let us know.**

VictoriaBC,stevo911_,"Dog Rescues in Vic So I know there are the usual suspects like the SCPA, Victoria Adoptables, Broken Promises, Victoria Humane Society, etc...

I was wondering if you guys know of any other private/smaller rescues?

I ran into a lady who does it as a hobby (she works with shelters in California) and she goes across the border to pick them up and brings them back, all she charges is the costs of importing them/etc... (not for profit).

I've been trying to track her down (or someone who does a similar thing) but I can't remember her name, I thinks its Rosalind or something similar.

I ask because when we move we're looking at getting a dog, and have narrowed it down to a few specific breeds (due to size limits of stratas, temperament and energy levels of certain breeds, and allergies).  We would much rather get a rescue than go to a breeder, don't need or care if it's a purebred dog, and there seems to be way more of them south of the border that need rescuing before they're put down.

VictoriaBC,stevo911_,"Truck that struck cyclist appears to have done so intentionally, and may be linked to another road rage incident involving cyclist Sounds like somebody might deserve a permanent driving ban.

From the TC:

>A school bus driver who witnessed the hit-and-run that injured a 14-year-old competitive cyclist says the driver of a pickup truck veered into the bike lane and appeared to intentionally hit the teen.
As Saanich police continue to look for the driver, cyclists have told investigators about a road-rage incident last month involving a similar-looking truck that could be connected to Friday’s incident.
Paul Robinson was finishing his bus route and driving down Willis Point Road near Wallace Drive about 4 p.m. Friday when he saw Megan Barnes and a fellow cyclist riding single file on the paved shoulder. He said a grey, newer-model Dodge Dakota truck came up behind Megan and “suddenly veered off into the right-hand bike lane.”
On a straight stretch of road, there was no reason for the truck to leave its lane, he said. “That truck deliberately went into the bike lane. [The cyclists] were doing exactly what cyclists should be doing on the road. They were out of harm’s way. There’s no reason that person should have crossed that line.”
The impact sent Megan flying about five metres into the ditch. Robinson stopped his bus to help, as did two other drivers, and 911 was called.
Robinson looked back and saw the truck stop momentarily before driving west on Willis Point Road. He didn’t have time to get the licence plate number.
Robinson described the driver as a middle-age, heavy-set blond woman.
Megan suffered minor scrapes and bruises, but Robinson said the injuries could have been much worse. “She could have been killed,” he said.
Lister Farrar, Megan’s Tripleshot Youth Team cycling coach, said that while talking about the incident on Sunday, two cyclists shared a story about a road-rage incident a month ago in the West Shore involving a truck with a similar description.
“There was an aggressive driver behind them, and it swerved in front of them and then slammed on the brakes,” he said.
One of the cyclists slammed into the back bumper, then fell off the bike. The other cyclist chased   the truck and was able to take a photo of the licence plate. The incident was reported to West Shore RCMP and the information has since been provided to Saanich police, Farrar said.
Farrar said it’s deeply concerning for the cycling community that “this person is able to do this apparently twice or more and somehow they haven’t been stopped.”
Robinson hopes the driver will turn herself in. “Do the right thing. Come forward, take responsibility for what you did.”
Saanich police ask anyone with information about the hit-and-run or the driver and vehicle involved to contact them at 250-475-4321, or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).

We are researchers from the University of British Columbia conducting a national study of technology use and communication between people involved in the sale and purchase of sexual services in Canada. Following recent legislative changes targeting print and online spaces where sexual services are advertised and communication takes place, our research aims to better understand the diverse ways that Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) such as cell phones, social media, message boards, websites, and the internet more generally, influence how people involved in the sale and purchase of sexual services develop connections, exchange information, and negotiate the details of the sex for money exchange (e.g., services, fees, and locale).

If you currently reside in Canada and have experience purchasing sexual services OR providing sexual services in exchange for money, you are invited to take an anonymous and confidential 30-60 min survey about how you use technology. Must be 18+ to participate. New or experienced, one time or frequent, all levels of experience welcome. For more information about the study or to take the anonymous online survey, visit: https://www.street-to-screen.ca

This is a study that can help contribute much needed empirical evidence about the Canadian sex industry.

So I referenced [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/7zqwp6/biking_from_downtown_to_goldstream/) post and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/6aycke/best_way_to_goldstream/) and they have me a bit worried about dragging my less confident friends along on bikes for our planned weekend at Goldstream in two weeks' time.  We did Salt Spring from Vancouver last year, and the hilly, gravel strewn shoulders with trucks and ferry traffic roaring by out of Ganges was a bit uncomfortable for them; I'd hate to subject them to more of the same (Ruckle itself was beautiful though, and the route to Fulford Harbour was more pleasant.)  That said, the campground's booked and we're committed, so I'm just hoping to mitigate the 'confident cyclists only' segments as much as possible and hopefully not put them off bike camping in future. 
  
This blog has offered me the most hope: http://kellyhays.ca/map_route/cycling-from-victoria-to-goldstream-no-highways/    

Has infrastructure changed since its publication? Does it make sense to take Atkins off the Galloping Goose as they show in the blog and one person noted in the Reddit comment (bit more elevation from street view) or better to do Wale Rd to Goldstream Avenue through town there and *then* turn off Leigh Rd to take the Ed Nixon Trail?    
From what I can tell a lot of Amy Rd has a sidewalk on one side so if anyone's feeling uncomfortable there, we can definitely walk or slow roll the sidewalk.   
    
Appreciate any input!  
**Edit:  
Thanks again for the help! We had a great ride - as safe and flat as advertised. Map: https://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/2546550802  
 We took the standard Lochside/Galloping Goose to Victoria to meet with friends at Spinnaker's and then from down there we took the E&N (which has progressed even further than October street view or Google's bike route green lines had suggested in parts) and cut off the Goose at Wale Rd to go through Goldstream to stop in for groceries off Jacklin Rd before cutting over on the mixed-use-path behind it along Rex and then the Ed Nixon trail - Henson Trail to Amy & the campground!

VictoriaBC,sunnodds,"Autumn Autumn in the Capital is strewn with leaves departing the trees like a rush of traffic homeward.  Blustery, bestowed with an evanescence of green even while colour bleeds into every corner and walkway.  The people wander pathways and cobble over beaches while sun leaks only from a corner of the warmth of summer.  Some find it in a window, on a perch, or leaning at last to sunset.  Cool weather will steal the charm eventually, replacing ins and outs with each other.  More time spent indoors, and less out, reveals the cacophany of winter.  It is a Canadian ritual, even here amid the bliss of snowdrops, and an occasional twist of snow.  It is here in the icy morning, and the dew that carries over after rain.  It is in the mist and the fog, the floating log draped in seagrass holding only a curve of the tide between it and the sea.    It is remembered while looking inland, and saved with a little grace, like gravy over Thanksgiving turkey.  Nothing imparts of it more than to say welcome again, after a season or two away, or one missed in the departure of simply thinking elsewhere.  All of our seasons here seem close, like the weather inside a calendar, imagined only from sprinkled photos.  Our joys come and go as if a garden should always grow only knowing the difference.  Time is spent in the beckoning of plants, and of walks, and of reasons to care.  Wandering is a pursuit of luxury, and of work met with daydreams.  The retiree and the youth visit similarly of a calm spot, a time adjusted to senses which remember play.  In their equal most have some perceptible interest, met with a look in every direction.  Canada holds loosely to this ideal in some way.  Tied together by an incentive to care.  Maybe it comes from here one day, and from there the next.  We cannot simply know, by counting flowers.  We can look up and into the weather, as it comes and goes.  We can move to a different window, and suppose the one of a friend meets us without looking back, still showing our gift of home.  We can stay as present as we are, among the coloured leaves, even after they are gone.  Knowing Spring here is a delicate decision, starting early like a mistaken alarm clock.  It comes with advice still telling of winter, even as it promises the furthest and deepest green through Autumn, again.  It is our calling perhaps, to suggest we live by it, for it, and to own something of it inside.  Like our country, it is a mindset bestowed with the bewildering potential of growth, turned out of the choices we make while imparting of our own experiences.  There can be an argument made to the nicety of choice always, but if it is luxury too much, it will probably only serve time alone.  Winter moves us away from that defining heroism, and should probably be remembered to cold justice.  So much is the pedlar of summer remembered, that perhaps we all will work harder then as peace recalls of us our land.  It is made of all the good things, and we know better.  Autumn is a good time to try.  It is a new way of waking to what awakens us all.  It is a leaf in the stream of time, but in our hearts it will flow toward the sea, the lake, the pond overlooking our rest.

Background: I'm with Juce, have been for quite a few years. I'm on a grandfathered plan that doesn't exist anymore, 25Mbps down / 2.5Mbps up for $44/mo.

A sales rep from Shaw came to our house, offered us 300Mbps down / 10Mbps up service for $53/mo, but first three months free, fourth through sixth months $15/mo, and I had to sign a two year contract. Claimed something about how Shaw has changed, and the offers are different now, something about a loyalty department.

We bought our first home in the Shelbourne-Hillside area two years ago with tons of help from family. It's an old house and we spend most of our money restoring and upgrading. We plan to be here awhile.

So the house across the street sold last year, and it seems to be rented out to a couple of students. That would be fine, BUT the tenants change frequently, take up most of the parking on the street, and often park in front of our house and block our driveway.

It sounds cliche, but every now and again a REALLY expensive car like a new Mercedes, or (no shtting, in Victoria) a Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder parks out front for a day. Maybe it's ok but it just seems weird.

The last straw was tonight when another new car, from Alberta, pulled up and parked on our newly seeded lawn, completely tearing up the sod. The passenger got out and walked, again, all over our new lawn, ignoring the stakes, strings, and flags. Then the car turned around and parked at the house across the street anyhow-after messing up our new lawn-and unloaded a bed for (I assume) another new tenant). When I pointed this out to them they ignored me, didn't even say a thing, just went into the house.

We've called the police numerous times about the bad parking (blocking a entrance way), but the neighbours just ignore us and haven't once said ""boo"" or ""hey, sorry!"". Any homeowners in Victoria (or otherwise) have any advice other than grin and bear it? any avenues with the municipality (Saanich)?

EDIT:  Wow, appreciate all the support. Our house isn't located among all the holding properties on Shelbourne - thankfully - but we are trying to hold back the ""horde"" on our block.

I’ve seen a couple people who are still convinced that we should close restaurants (open only for takeout). Just wanted to give my experience as a restaurant employee from the last 2 weeks just if anyone is curious: 
-sales on our busiest day (Sunday morning) were halved
-my employer is now telling people to wear their masks when they get up (which I was afraid he wouldn’t)
-we haven’t gotten a lot of big tables lately. Before the restrictions we would constantly get big parties and have to put them at two tables. Since the restrictions we haven’t had to do this. The only times we have tables over 4 ppl are when work groups come in. This is interesting cause technically they aren’t from the same household... but we allow it cause money I guess? Point is majority of customers are groups of 1-2
-HUGE increase in pick up orders!! Glad to see it. 

Was wondering what other employees and customers are observing? We haven’t been asking customers if they’re from the same household so I would say that’s the one rule we aren’t enforcing. I would love to enforce this myself but I feel like my owner won’t cause we’ve been so slow and he doesn’t wanna reject any customers.

Any renter or informed person in Greater Victoria knows or has been directly affected by the current housing shortage/crisis.
As a renter all I wish for is stable and secure housing; the chance to build a life and a family where I work and live.
But many who attend municipal meetings are not of this demographic - please consider speaking or writing in to support this motion and have your voice heard!

The most important housing policy to go in front of Victoria Council will be coming up on April 14th at 6:30pm on https://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/city/mayor-council-committees/council-committee-meetings.html
Write, record, or register to speak by emailing MayorandCouncil@victoria.ca

The Rapid Deployment of Affordable Housing is aimed to speed up affordable housing and remove the risk of these projects getting shut down.
This is going to be a highly contentious vote because it REMOVES councils power to say NO to affordable housing.
Approving this policy would have many benefits related to the city’s housing supply, tight rental market, and the escalating living costs.
It would reduce development timelines, increase development certainty, depoliticize more inclusive housing options, cut red tape, and lower the cost of construction.
Taken together, these features would improve housing affordability, availability, and start to push back against escalating rents and persistently low vacancy rates.

Please consider writing, speaking, or recording your voice for this issue - tell your lived experience!

The majority of Victoria is zoned R1B (single family only), as we experience the worsening state of housing and environmental issues it seems illogical that the majority of the land would only allow the most inefficient type of housing.

VictoriaBC,templeofninpo,"I Am More Qualified Than A Stick: My Mayoral Campaign Platform (updated 07/18/2022)

**A MANDATE OF EQUILIBRIUM**

*(because calling it Politically Enlightened Austerity is too frightening)*

&#x200B;

I've spoken well before and have written well before, generally without concern of speaking or writing well. I am a high school dropout with an anxiety-fueled appreciation of academia. These things you need to know about me as I hum and haw at whatever official podiums are offered during Victoria's upcoming mayoral race.

&#x200B;

My platform is radical and, on the surface, ridiculous. I would see a reversal of the condominium hellscape growing around us. I would see a total correction of the brazenly-imposed addiction epidemic, and I would see the inception of a globally-renowned volunteer gardening project that would blanket this city in food.

&#x200B;

These things are easy to say, bringing to mind the dichotomy between what can be considered as 'the noble ideal' versus what can be considered as 'the noble reality'.

&#x200B;

The 'noble reality', once I became mayor, would be that almost every initiative offered will be resisted at almost every level. Leaving my power and authority to, at best, vote no where a generic establishment mayor would vote yes and vise versa. Surprisingly, with significant support coming from a suppressed police community which stands to have the respect and honour lost under Victoria's long standing municipal cabal rekindled. Presupposing I'm not assassinated day one.

&#x200B;

The 'noble ideal' being an acceptance of the truth of the 'blue bridge' scandal. That we did not incur fantastic debt because we needed to replace it, we needed to replace it to incur fantastic debt. $120,000,000+ to build an earthquake resistant bridge that isn't earthquake resistant. Putting the City in an unfortunate position where it must build up and steal the sky in an attempt to put ourselves in the black. A cultish lack of foresight pretending there will always be enough food and water for an exponentially expanding population.

&#x200B;

The 'noble ideal' being an acceptance of the truth that the addiction epidemic has been imposed by those who see only danger to the housing market upon the normalization of tent-cities. That crack, crystal meth and heroin has invaded our streets and crushed the peace of public spaces not as a natural consequence of rampant and 'immoral' capitalism but instead as a phenomenon that has been literally fostered and allowed, to imbue into the minds of the public the 'inherent unfeasibleness' of living rent-free in public.

&#x200B;

**REGARDING THE MUNICIPAL BUDGET**

&#x200B;

We are ridiculously in debt yet pretending affluence in an attempt to not frighten off investors. I, on the other hand (being a poverty-avowed monk) see the legitimacy that would be gained via prioritizing a non-psychotic escape from our current indentured state. Instead of arbitrarily building as many skyscrapers as possible to simply give the appearance of revenue generation we would acknowledge that the world is actually entering an almost unimaginable financial collapse and do everything in our power to find fiscal balance without actually resigning ourselves to the backroom schemes of manufacturing consent. 

&#x200B;

Equating austerity with maturity we will sell every non-essential municipally-owned asset, criminally investigate the 'blue bridge' nonsense (ultimately seeking complete forfeiture of personal assets to the municipality from those who signed off on the loan). We garnered fantastic debt implicitly depending on the capacity to build condos everywhere. Ceasing the condo construction means finding a way to escape our indentured status that doesn't include this acceptance of normalized psychotic marketing to arbitrarily attract people to come pay rent here.

&#x200B;

**ON POLICING**

&#x200B;

As Mayor of Victoria I will work to initiate a new, free/creatively-affordable, deputy training program. Which will be overseen by police veterans and martial instructors who will teach conduct (protocol, the nature of conscientiousness and why innocent presumption is so important) and combat taijutsu. I've in mind a grand obstacle course that will attract the respect of police forces and militaries worldwide.

&#x200B;

As it stands, this City has adopted a philosophy of facade. No longer will we insist on 'keeping up appearances' by buying new police cars every year, instead we'll enjoy maintaining what we already have. That said, I've seen the usefulness of having one or two personal flying machines (akin to the Flyboard Air) at the disposal of the City's emergency services.

&#x200B;

If by the time I would become Mayor there is still capacity to select the Chief of Police I will be doing so from within their own ranks.

&#x200B;

**ON THE CORRECTION OF THE ADDICTION EPIDEMIC**

&#x200B;

The inception of a 'diversion' (in the category of 'community service', allowing the waiving of charges if certain conditions are met) of a 3-4 month detox (where tobacco and marijuana are available). The program would also accept voluntary intakes. For this to work we will also need strictly dry (from crack, crystal meth and heroin) tent-cities so that those in the program are not faced with having to pretend to love the system that inspired their addiction in the first place to reintegrate into society.

&#x200B;

Simply, we cannot afford to acquiesce to the faux progressivism any more. What we've done is monstrous. Like putting out a million bird-feeders knowing full well we only have enough feed for a very short amount of time. Every addict has been a pawn. Responsibility for every life and family that has been destroyed lies on the doorsteps of City Hall and the Chamber of Commerce and whatever other forces that helm the politics of Victoria. Anywhere else we'd be calling it a war crime.

&#x200B;

The amount of money spent buying and maintaining converted hotels and providing food and services (for years now) would have covered the cost of mass detox multiple times over.

&#x200B;

At the beginning of the pandemic the province of BC was given 5 billion dollars in an effort to help us through. I imagine Vancouver Island/Victoria was given a fifth of it. When it runs out (I would guess within the next couple of years) what will we have to show?

&#x200B;

**ON TENT-CITIES AND GARDENS**

&#x200B;

Tent-cities cannot work without the cooperation and sanction of the City. The bad addictive drugs have been a perfect weapon in helping the general public not care about obviously Charter violate Bylaws that insist the public doesn't have the right to sleep during the day.

&#x200B;

You know why Cities put themselves in debt? Because declaring states of emergency is bad for tourism. In the fall of 2008 this city was given the rarest opportunity with the BC Supreme Court's acknowledgement of sleep as a right but foresight was hidden under it's greed. So instead it escalated the problem while removing opportunity to set a learned foundation. They call it politics.

&#x200B;

I see Charter compliant community driven tent-cities that are populated with those who know ALL obnoxious behaviour may as well be a professional affront to sow disrepute. I see family tent-cities, I see student tent-cities. I see gardener tent-cities. I see traveller tent-cities. All appreciating the natural bounds of tent-city's existence.

&#x200B;

With the notoriety of being the first city in the Commonwealth to sanction tent-cities of course there will be risk of attracting the poor and rent-adverse from all over Canada. Which is why it will be incumbent on the City to let every other municipality in the nation know of the precedent set in the BC Supreme Court so they they can establish their own responses in their own towns.

&#x200B;

Speaking of gardens. The City will engage in a popularization of insightful gardening, offering a path to those born to it. AKA food grows on trees and healthy sleep is mechanically possible without rent. With all parks departments at our disposal there is great advantage. Every lawn owner given the option to take half the produce if their space can be managed by the volunteer project.

&#x200B;

**VACCINE MANDATES AND MY TINFOIL HAT**

&#x200B;

Why is it so hard for people to conjecture a scheme to cement global domination coming from within our own government? Many are indignantly vocalizing the stress of staffing shortages only months after firing thousands. Even the primary homeless association, Our Place Society, will not have completely healthy non-vaccinated people help mop, do dishes or fold towels, even while their own staff are going bonkers with the stress of a wholly unnatural circumstance.

&#x200B;

As the mayor of Victoria I would not bother working to outlaw the Freemasons beyond just shining with the truth so much so that they would simply diminish, drowning in their shame. I very much have a beautification project in mind for their 'Grand' temple at 666 Fisgard (side note: look up 666 Pandora Avenue on Google Maps).

&#x200B;

The world is changing and to survive we will need dependence on community. Time to be bold and stoic, challenging all our subtle complicities and preconceptions. We just have to know how bad it is to let the darkness rule the night. AKA it is abominable that a municipality put itself into debt. Obviously it was a naïve 'everyone else is doing it' thing, but the hard fact is a noble city does not let itself become desperate because then it is owned.

&#x200B;

My name is David Arthur Johnston and I cannot be bought or instigated. I am painfully aware of the necessity of declaring a state of emergency and the impossibility of doing so in a town that presumes to depend on a billion dollar tourism industry. In this regard, I know the middle way. I was made for this.

&#x200B;

**PS:** *As Mayor my poverty-avowment will be reconciled by acting as I did in preparation of my monkish transformation. Which is to say I will do what is possible and necessary to bring Victoria's books into the black so that it may responsibly face the future without being indentured. I will also not be accepting a salary (to the potential joy of the mother of my children if she is inspired to sue).*

&#x200B;

**PPS:** *If you think free-will is real you are a victim of genuine brainwashing. Mechanically, there is only one thing/motion which all that exists is an extension. We do not choose, life divines (analyzes) through it's experience towards what it perceives as it's best peace. Its the actual reason pride is sin/insane. Knowing evil is a fiction we lose the capacity to hate. Knowing what God looks like grants the boggling wisdom of knowing what God doesn't look like.

I provide an automotive computer flashing service which requires customers to send me their products, I modify them and send them back. Or I import the parts, modify them and sell them.  


Most of my business comes out of the USA. For parts importing I have found Seawings to be OK for speed/cost ($18 per package up to 5lb).

He lacks a nose, his face is misshapen, sunk in, children stare at him in the stores, and has no upper teeth (dentures once, but it didn’t work long term). He moved to Victoria 3 years ago and hasn’t been able to make a single friend. Maybe you’ve seen him at the local rec centre, he’s a good guy.

He rides his motorcycle and he’s thinking of giving it up because he’s tired of riding alone. I’ve suggested the Lower Island Riding Club but he hasn’t had any success through it. He’s tried local meet up groups but due to his limited and restricted diet, they always want to do a lunch or something and he just can’t do it.

It really breaks my heart to see him so lonely, and I feel like my mother and I have done everything we can to try and get him out and about. He feels as though people are avoidant of him due to his appearance, and that may be the case, but I’m looking for another avenue that maybe a local Redditor can help me out with. Thank you for listening.

Out of all the people who have reached out, he’s found a few solid friends from those emails.

He has a social circle now. He looks forward to hanging out with people. It’s amazing.

Just recently, he underwent surgery to repair exposed bone on his nose with a skin graft. He was recovering for over a month without leaving the house, so he didn’t see these new friends he made. When he went back out and saw the people who became a part of his life, he said it was such a good feeling, like a homecoming.

TLDR: Campbell Construction may be putting your community at risk so the [rich owners](https://www.timescolonist.com/business/campbell-construction-marks-50-years-of-building-victoria-landmarks-1.1466142) can keep getting richer. 

Campbell construction is making veiled threats to their carpenters about future job security and not allowing them to stay home if they’re concerned about the spread of Covid-19. Campbell is threatening their sub-contractors with legal action if they don’t keep sending people to site. 
These are just blue collar people trying to provide for their families and they can’t afford to be black listed from Campbell sites in the future because Campbell runs so many of the projects in the CRD. 

Tradespeople are worried about their community and families, most of them don’t want to be onsite helping the virus spread. The very [rich owners](https://www.timescolonist.com/business/campbell-construction-marks-50-years-of-building-victoria-landmarks-1.1466142) of Campbell are bullying and forcing them to be at work from the safety of their own self isolation. 

These large job sites are going to allow the virus to continue spreading rapidly through our community, counteracting the efforts of everyone who is already self isolating. If an office of 20 people who all have their own workstation has to shut down, how can we keep open sites of 50 to 200 people where everyone has to share job boxes, access ladders, tools, saw horses, porta-potties?

Some sites have access ladders that everyone has to use to get from one floor to the next and there’s no sanitizer at the top or bottom. Not touching your face is impossible as a tradesperson because you’d never be able to adjust your eye protection, respiratory protection, or ear protection. Anyone who works with this type of PPE knows that it needs periodic adjustments as you carry out your job. Job sites are just plain dirty. It’s much, much harder to adhere to the stringent precautions to slow the spread of the virus when carrying out dirty, physical labour as opposed to being in a clean, controlled office. 

The carpenters can’t speak up because they will get black listed from all sites. The sub-contractors can’t defy Campbell because they will get sued and black listed from all future work. The carpenters union is doing nothing to keep their members safe even though they collect money from those members every month. 

Construction for vital infrastructure and healthcare facilities is essential and needs to continue but the job sites need to be heavily altered and staggered shifts need to be implemented to cut density. No one is going to die because condos got put on hold for a few weeks/months while we try to flatten the curve. 

Campbell construction may be putting your community at risk so the rich owners can continue to get richer. 

If you’re not in the construction industry and you care about this issue, please call out Campbell on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Tweet at Bonnie Henry and Adrian Dix and ask them why they are encouraging this to happen. Tweet the carpenters union and ask them what they’re doing.

VictoriaBC,thelawnranger,"Victoria councillors seek taxpayers’ support for 50% pay hike : TC article The City of Victoria is checking with taxpayers to see whether they would support a more than 50 per cent increase in salary and benefits for councillors.

In an online budget survey, the city asks whether respondents agree with increasing councillors’ remuneration to $70,100 a year — the same as the median income of a city employee, excluding police officers and firefighters.

“This would result in an increase of approximately $25,700 per councillor annually,” the question says.

The increases for each councillor would cost the city about $205,600 a year, the survey says.

Statistics Canada reports that the median total income in Greater Victoria was $40,500 in 2017.

Councillors are currently paid $45,384 with an annual increase tied to inflation. The figures in the survey are rounded, so they do not align precisely with councillors’ actual pay, city staff say.

There is no mention in the survey of altering the pay for Mayor Lisa Helps, who is paid $113,461 annually.

The survey question stems from Coun. Ben Isitt’s motion — approved by council last month — that asked city staff to investigate the costs associated with paying councillors the same as the median income of a city employee. An amendment to the motion directed staff to get the public’s feedback on the matter during the budget process.

“The city hasn’t reviewed council remuneration for more than a decade,” Isitt said in an interview Thursday.

“The demands on council members’ time is certainly increasing [to] anywhere from 40 to 60 hours a week.

“It strikes me that if we want to attract professionals and others, and not just have very wealthy people serve on council, I think we do have to set the compensation at a level that younger people wouldn’t see it as a huge penalty if they’re going to take some time out of their career.

“And, unlike other municipalities in the region, you can’t have an ordinary job and be a council member [in Victoria]. This week, we have three days of meetings and that’s very regular.”

Isitt said once the public has commented, the issue will come back to council for a discussion.

He noted previously that council could choose to appoint a citizens’ committee or hire an independent consultant to do a comparative review of councillors’ pay.

Current salaries were set in 2009 based on recommendations from a citizens’ committee.

Coun. Charlayne Thornton-Joe said in an interview Thursday that she has concerns about the size of the increase outlined in the budget survey, and she’s glad council decided to get the public’s feedback.

She noted the survey is a preliminary step that will be followed by debate at the council table. “We’re not there yet and there’ll be a lot of discussions on whether there’ll be an independent group looking at [it].”

Thornton-Joe said she’s adamant that whatever council decides, any changes should apply to the next council, “so that we’re not voting for our own increase.”

She said that, if it’s decided at some point to pay councillors for full-time work, there should be a requirement for them to put in those hours.

“I think if it goes to full-time hours, there has to be some expectation that all of us do full-time hours, which means that you shouldn’t be able to do another part-time job.”

Thornton-Joe agreed that it can be challenging to attract people to serve on council given the pay level, long hours, evening and weekend work, and the large amount of correspondence that councillors receive.

“[It’s] definitely more than full-time [work],” she said.

Anyone wishing to express an opinion on councillors’ pay or other budget issues can take the online survey until Nov. 24 at victoria.ca. The city’s draft budget documents are available on the site.

In addition, people can take part in a Budget Town Hall meeting at city hall on Nov. 21, beginning at 6:30 p.m. During the meeting, city officials will accept comments in person, online, by telephone or by way of social media.

Youth can participate in budget discussions that same evening from 6 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at the Quadra Village Community Centre, 901 Kings Rd.

People can also provide feedback by sending an email to engage@victoria.ca with “Feedback on the Draft 2020 Budget” in the subject line.

VictoriaBC,themadmaria89,"How to start over life in Victoria BC after a terrible social experience? I was a youthful and energetic 21 year old when I moved to Victoria BC. I was full of hopes and plans about what this city can offer. I am an immigrant, recent college graduate at the time.

Soon after I graduated, I moved to Victoria BC to be with my mother and father. I have no siblings. I also have no other family in this city. I was initially very social and ready to meet a lot of new people. Naive about life, but ready to learn from Victoria. I basically have spent my whole entire life at this point studying so I thought I'd enjoy life for a bit before really pursuing the career I wanted. I socialized a lot and it seemed like I was off to a good path which led me to find a clique I considered my main friends but they made me feel unwanted and unwelcome for the next five years of my life. I was confused and clueless as to why i felt I wasnt fully in, is it because I just didnt know the culture here? Is my gut wrong? They acted distant but spoke to me as if they cared. IT. WAS. CONFUSING! Emotionally abusive. When you are young and new to a city, you'd put up with anything. This was the biggest mistake of my life, they say you have to surround yourself with good people. I failed that.

From a happy excited young individual, I turned into a sad and depressed person all because I felt like i wasn't welcome and unwanted in the city. As anticipated, my friendship with them ended and i realized there are just shitty people in this world (safe to say I am not a problem since they did it to a girl before me, and another one as of now) and I had to start over at 27. It has been almost 3 years since and I am just starting to get over the betrayal I experienced from these people, it was hard and I couldn't stop talking about it. We are talking about MEAN GIRLS CLUB here, I couldn't believe this is still happening. Now you might think I must have done something terrible, no, i thought about it and spoken to people around us, and it is clear that it really is just about being the one girl in every group of girls that they don't like because you are different. I was the NEW girl that some girls don't like for no reason. At this point, I am a changed person, I am no longer the same jolly person. I have clearly made bad choices in life, including trusting the wrong people, and I learned that the hard way. I am just currently baffled about how I should start over in my late 20s. It was already hard to make friends in Victoria to begin with when I was 21. It is almost impossible to create meaningful relationships here especially in my late 20s. 

I am currently about to start a new career as a nurse which I am passionate about but I know that it is hard to make friends with people who do shift work. This isn't clearly the life I wanted for myself and I have few close friends scattered around the city who also has no idea how to socially survive here.

The opportunities are also limited here, there is not a lot going on. I don't even know how to begin thinking about moving to Vancouver which from what I heard is 10x socially worse than Victoria. I need new people, understanding and kind. But that is hard to find in Victoria.

I never learned how to socially connect here.

So my question is, how does one live a meaningful life in Victoria BC? I love to explore and go out but I have no one to do this with. People here are polite but not very welcoming. Everyone has established social circles that are impenetrable. I came here full of hope, with good intentions and it felt like nobody wanted that. I am afraid to lose my youth and all I can focus on is myself but we are humans naturally looking for social connections and I get to a point where I feel like life is not even worth living here anymore. Life goes by so fast.

Dennis Danielson

A commentary by an emeritus professor of English at the University of British Columbia and a native of Victoria.

Today I’m coming out as a ­colonial. It’s who I am, and I won’t deny my identity as a ­colonial any longer.

I’ve always been a colonial — from even before I knew I was one. But today I’m declaring it publicly: a colonial is who I am, and I’m proud of my identity.

I was born in a thrice-colonially named place: Victoria. British. Columbia. When I was just four years old, I sat on the curb on Douglas Street for a parade celebrating the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, and I waved my little Union Jack.

Yes, that’s a flag I’m still proud of, along with that other great flag, the red and white one with the maple leaf on it. (No contradiction there!)

I attended schools named for people and places in (or from) what back then was still often called the Old Country: ­Doncaster, Lansdowne, (Mount) Douglas. And I was proud to do so.

At home, when I was growing up, my family subscribed to a newspaper called The Victoria Daily Colonist.

Oh, and maybe you’ve guessed this already. As a child I was taught a colonial dialect: English. It’s a heritage that still makes me proud and grateful.

Many, many people whose first language was something else have gone to the trouble of learning English for themselves — so many, in fact, that it’s now spoken and understood all around the world.

You could call it the Common Tongue. (Which is not to diminish the riches of all those other languages that people speak. Diversity’s good, eh?)

But here’s the problem. Some people disapprove of colonials. They judge me for being what I am.

They’re even anti-colonial — or (heaven forbid) colonial phobic. They think that colonials like me should repent of what we are and pretend to be post-colonial or maybe, um, transition to something else (I don’t know what).

We should hate the colonial in ourselves.

Nope. I won’t do that. Proud colonial is what I am. Grateful too. And, being born here, I’m also proud and grateful to be a native!

Lots of other people these days are celebrated — even demand to be celebrated — for something about themselves they claim to have discovered and not just imagined or chosen. They’re proud of it.

Well, that’s just fine.

But as I said, I’ve discovered I’m a colonial, and I’m proud of that. Being just a tiny bit humble, however, I don’t have the nerve to demand that you celebrate my being a ­colonial. And no, I won’t insist that everybody observe a “colonial month.”

When I was growing up, I was taught at both home and school that toleration is a good thing, and I still think it is. (I also think that active reconciliation among different groups of people is a very good thing, but that’s another op-ed.)

So please, all I ask is that you tolerate me for who I am: a colonial. Or, put more starkly, if you don’t like colonials like me, just get over it.

As we’d say when I was a teenager, like it or lump it.

VictoriaBC,thetrivialstuff,"A whacky (and possibly naive) proposal to bring rents down What about a municipal income tax on rental profits? Specifically profits, structured like this: a landlord charges rent, and gets to deduct all mortgage and property maintenance expenses, and even deduct a wage for themselves for any activities related to maintaining the property. So you take the total rent charged to tenants in a house or building, then you subtract mortgage payments, an hourly wage for every tenant phonecall, paperwork, listing the property for rent, etc., every time spent hiring contractors for repairs, materials, and so on. Basically the idea is to be generous to the landlord.

But, anything left over after that (pure profit), is taxed heavily. Why? Because any money above all those deductions is, pretty much by definition, a drain on society. It's money the landlord is getting that isn't in exchange for useful work (because we've deducted all of that, remember). This means that for some landlords, unless they're maintaining a lot of properties, their rental income probably isn't enough to live on any more - and that's completely fair; if their tenants have to work 40 hours a week to live here, then they can do the same.

But wait, there's more! One more deduction on that tax - a rebate/credit for the amount by which a landlord is undercutting the market rent. And you make it apply to federal taxes - that's right, you can save money on your federal income tax by charging less rent!

So now the landlords have incentive to:

- maintain their properties really well, to get all those sweet deductions
- charge less and less rent

Eventually the rent settles at a rate where renters and owners are paying almost the same amount to live here: owners pay in property taxes, mortgage, and personal time and aggravation to maintain their house, and renters pay about the same, except that they also pay their landlord's wages for being their property maintenance manager, so they pay a bit more in cash and a bit less in personal time and aggravation.

Over the past several years, Vancouver Coastal Health has been supporting the SMART addiction recovery program. SMART stands for Self-Management and Recovery Training. It encourages individuals to gain independence from addictive behaviors using cognitive behavioral therapy and motivational interviewing. It has 4 main objectives:

1. To maintain motivation for abstinence
2. To cope with urges and craving
3. To manage thoughts, feelings and behaviours 
4. To have a balanced lifestyle.

All the SMART face-to-face meetings have been cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak. However, we have decided to facilitate a few online meetings every week via Zoom.

I am writing this as I have had no luck with traditional job searches. The problem is that although I have work experience in several fields (the fields you would expect a 25 year old with no university degree to have experience in) I have sort of crapped up at least my most important reference. I worked as a clerk at the hospital for over three years but my life fell apart and things did not work out.

I have restaurant experience as well and have worked for about 5 years total in restaurants. I can pretty much do anything that requires little formal training as I test as having well above average IQ and have worked all my life to enhance my critical thinking skills. I also have taken a 10 month Sprott-Shaw diploma programme in office management. I have self-taught medical terminology (though I have a certificate), above average computer skills, and a typing speed of at least 55wpm.

I have recently been diagnosed as having Asperger's which has led to more complication but importantly this revelation has led the thought to crystallize in my mind that perhaps a job with limited social interaction would be preferable, but beggars cannot be choosers.

The bottom line is that I am willing to do anything, work hard, get paid any amount (minimum or above), and work any hours. Even if you have yard work you need done this is something I would appreciate.

VictoriaBC,throwawayvicbc,"Dealing with racist threats in a shared residence? Hi /VictoriaBC. I am living in a multiroom housing complex where, just early this month, I had my room broken into and encountered an attempt theft by a guest of another tenant at the property. The other tenant later came out of her room and started screaming towards me, uttering violent racist threats (""I'm going to fucking slit your throat, you fucking ******""). She also pushed me, and I responded proportionately in self-defence. I later caught a segment of the event with my camera where the tenant confirmed her racist outbursts (""so what if I called you that? That's what you are!""). I was so angry and later called the police and landlord. Unfortunately, the police was completely unhelpful and advised me to simply calm down.

I was originally banking on the surveillance camera footage that should have captured everything on camera. I was told be the landlord that it broke (this is the second time he told me this. The last time was when I had my food stolen in one of the shared fridges in the common room, and I was told the surveillance camera ""broke"" when I complained). In the absence of the footage that had everything on record, I can only rely on my self-captured video where the tenant confirmed her racist outbursts. She also claims I ""attacked"" her and continues to lie about things I have not done. In the video, her dad is seen as coming in to defend her, saying ""so what? She called you names. Grow up. What the fuck are you going to do about it?"" I was incensed.

I've been trying to evict the other tenant, but as I understand, this would require the landlord to provide an eviction notice. So far, the landlord and the property manager have been trying to avoid dealing with the issue for over a month, saying they're busy or are on vacation. The property manager, in particular, was incredibly rude, telling me over the phone once that ""he had no time to deal with the little argument between you two."" It seems to me they simply don't want to deal with the problem, preferring to settle it informally. They won't evict the other tenant because they fear she would contest the eviction and they would end up having to ""waste time"" (in their words) going to the arbitration at the Residential Tenancy Branch.

I'm at total wits end here. I've been trying to extract at least a written apology from other tenant for the inexcusable violent racist threats with the supposed help of the landlord. But I've just learned that this is unlikely to happen, as the plan seems to involve me to also provide an ""apology."" I am absolutely furious about this and would absolutely not accept such an arrangement.

Is there anything I can do to hopefully punish the tenant in question for her outrageous behavior?

Edit: Sorry, I just read the rules regarding throwaways. This is actually my first time registering on Reddit. I am only a lurker so don't really have a ""main account"" so to speak.

VictoriaBC,tibbsonaphone,"Any Prescription Eyewear Store with Athletic Glasses/Goggles in Town? Hello All,

I’m wondering if anyone knows of a place selling prescription athletic/sports glasses in town. I don’t want the elite pro-athlete goggles you’d see on NBA All stars. What I have in mind is something similar in appearance to traditional glasses, but with a band instead of arms. I’ve included a photo which is very close to what I’m looking for, but I’d prefer a thinner band without a corporate logo splashed on it. I am aware of online options, but I’d really like to try a pair before spending hundreds. I’ve also been told that I have a tricky prescription. Half the glasses I’ve owned where delayed because the lenses had to be remade, and not all frames can accommodate my lens requirements, so I’m hesitant to order online for those reasons. I’m into a lot of fitness and outdoor activities (Martial Arts, Cycling, Weightlifting, Swimming). I used to have an old/backup pair that I wore for sports, but they’re bent out of shape now, and I don’t like switching between them and my recent prescription. 

I basically don’t want to worry about the glasses falling off my face, or having them break, and some part gets lost. I’ve had to scour my bedroom carpet holding one lens like a monocle, all to find a tiny screw that fell out. I’d really like my next pair to be a purpose-built athletic set. They need to be very secure on my face, they should have a design that holds the lenses in place with something better than a single tiny screw, and they must be as close to indestructible as possible. Thanks in advance for any suggestions. I will likely order online if there isn’t a local option, but given the expense of new glasses, I would like to try on a pair first. I’ve never bought athletic glasses before, so this is something new for me.

VictoriaBC,tipping-point-blank,"Langforders: you have the power to change things! Not sure if this has been posted here before, but I just wanted to mention that there's a growing movement of people living in Langford who are starting to push back against the way it's being governed here. Mayor and Council have done a great job liberating Langford from being the 'dogpatch' (as it was once referred to), but many of us feel that it's now gone too far. Entire mountainsides being stripped of every tree for suburban sprawl (when they should be densifying in the core), an expedited rezoning/permitting process that cuts corners and doesn't give enough time to address environmental concerns, complete lack of public input and transparency, conflicts of interest... this list goes on and on.

A grassroots group popped up a few months ago and already has 1,100 members, called Langford Voters for Change: [http://www.facebook.com/groups/langfordvotersforchange](http://www.facebook.com/groups/langfordvotersforchange). They are residents that are banding together to take action on these issues. If you live in Langford and share the same concerns, consider joining! It feels good to DO something about it!

They also just put out a petition to protect an ecologically sensitive parcel of land adjacent to Langford Lake, home to the endangered western painted turtle.

We're married, no kids, and we're on the hunt for a BC community to set down roots where we can contribute to the community and enjoy living in a place that has some of what we love about our Vancouver life while offering us more space at a lower price.

We both have chronic health stuff we deal with requiring access to family docs and access to specialists. We have jobs that may be mostly portable.

We're both coastal types, educated and enjoy living in neighbourhoods with a good sense of community. We are both digital natives, crafters, gamers, and work mostly online — so fast, reliable internet is a non-negotiable. 

We're nerdy urban-dwelling professionals and looking for a neighbourhood with some things that we have living in the Cambie Street/Main Street area of Vancouver - interesting periodic community events, groceries nearby, parks to walk the dog, people our age (35-50), creative programs/activities/events, local library, famers markets, good food and coffee places, a nice view. I love a thriving local culture - whether it's cycling or art or music or what have you. I love going into a coffee shop and seeing more people talking or art on the walls than uni students furiously studying (though I was one for a long time, so I don't begrudge them their study haunts). 

Neither of us are into driving a lot, though we do have a vehicle. 

We'd love it if any of you could answer a couple of questions we have about moving to your area.

1. How easy is it to get a regular family doctor?
2. Is there good, reliable high speed Internet? We're hoping for at least 100 mbps down and 50 mbps up.
3. How plentiful are home-based services? (e.g., grocery delivery, pet care, etc.)
4. If you know, how is the addictions-recovery community, in terms of regular meetings and specialists?
5. How walkable is the ""downtown"" area, and are there condos near that area?
6. What is there in terms of nature access (Local trails, parks, cycling routes, non-urban opportunities, etc.)

It should be noted we're looking to buy, not rent.

Thanks so much for your help, Reddit friends!! :)

VictoriaBC,tomismaximus,"Possible New Phone Scam - Girl crying on the line - You may call back to hear people talking in the background but no answer. My coworker just receive a call to her first-aid phone and it was just a person crying/wailing then the call ended. This is obviously worrying, though she did not recognize the number of even being Canadian, she still called back. On the call back she could hear two people talking to each other.. no answer. She called back again and it sounded exactly the same.  

I looked in to it, and it apparently started pretty recently where you'll receive a call of this crying girl, the call ends, then you're expected to call back - most likely incurring phone bill charges.  This might also be newer to BC since the news article from below is with some BC numbers, and an officer from VicPD received the same call today when my coworker was speaking to them. 

I used to work for Shaw and remember scams that customers would receive a call from someone and it would be ""Press 1 to be put on our do not call list"" and the person would press 1 and initiate an outgoing call that would charge them a couple dollars on their bill. I assume this crying girl scam is similar, where in the call-back you would be charged. And maybe the people talking in the background is so you would want to stay on the line for longer to try and listen to what's going on. 

So as normal, be weary of out of country calls, but if you do pick up/receive a voicemail like this, don't call back unless you obviously know the phone number.

I watched Maid and I feel very strange. This has never happened to me again. I am a dad and I have a 3y old kid and the show hit me hard. It made me think what I am capable of, how lucky I am to have a job and a lovely daughter. It also reminded me how I grew up in a poor family. How were  my parents struggling to grow us up living paycheck to paycheck. While I was watching the show I felt like ""what is happening to me?"".

But as I write to this sub, I will focus on the filming locations. I have already gone through the locations I found in google with street view and I feel so amazed. I am living in Southern Europe and the scenery is different here. I believe you are very lucky to have the chance to live in a place like this.

I wanted to ask you. Is real life living in VictoriaBC similar to the show?

* Is the **Oldfield's Save-On Gas** looking and feeling so retro?
* Are **Swartz Bay Terminal** and the **Terminal Fulford Harbour** so nostalgic?
* Is **Vancouver island** so lovely and green ?
* Are **the streets of Port Hampstead** like living in a dream?
* My best scene is in the **Matheson Lake**. I can't find words how I loved this place (from the TV screen at least). Is it so beautiful?
* Does Missoula look like that cozy and lovely?

Please be gentle and do not judge me. Even If it's dark and maybe ""it's just a show"", I feel like my life is mirrored a lot of times in it.

My name is Matt Rutherford and I am honoured to be apart of the 2015 Canadian Cancer Society, Cops for Cancer, Tour de Rock team. 

In today’s society it is safe to say that, whether directly or indirectly, everyone has been affected by cancer. Cancer has affected my life and the lives of those in my family with my dad and mother-in-law being diagnosed in 2010. Our family was blessed, as both my father and mother-in-law are currently cancer free.

I will never be able to comprehend how much physical pain these children will go through with cancer treatments and the emotional pain felt by their family. I am privileged to be able to raise funds to help ease this pain by assisting to enable these children to attend Camp Good Times.

Twenty-One of us will be embarking on this 1100 km bicycle ride for these kids. With every pedal stroke I make, I hope that it brings us closer to preventing this horrible disease. It is my wish that one-day police members do not have to ride the length of the island, as pediatric cancers become 100% curable.

The money raised from this event helps fund leading-edge cancer research that is improving cancer treatments, preventing cancer and saving lives; provide reliable and up-to-date information on cancer, risk reduction and treatment; offer vital community-based support services for people living with cancer and their families; and advocate for healthy public policies. Money also goes towards sending kids to Camp Goodtimes (www.campgoodtimes.org)

This is a cause that I feel passionately about and I'm asking you to support my efforts by donating. Any amount helps and I appreciate that you took time to visit my page.

=====

Timothy Chu is a 27 year old British national who works as a police officer with the Metropolitan Police in London. He went missing while diving in Canada on 5 July 2015, while on vacation.

The rescue team in Canada has called off the search on Monday night. We, as extremely anxious family and friends of Timothy, urgently petition for the British High Commission Ottawa to request the Canadian authorities to continue search for Timothy Chu.

Chu’s brother Joshua Chu said from Hong Kong Timothy is “skilled in survival and no stranger to challenge” having served in the British Army and named soldier of the year in 2011. We believe there is high hope that Timothy is still alive and must be found ASAP.

Please sign this petition so that the search for Timothy will continue.

VictoriaBC,vancoover,"Need advice from people who have moved from Vancouver to Victoria Hi all,

I've lived in Vancouver for about a decade and absolutely love this city.

Recently, a job opportunity has come up in Victoria that is exceptionally tempting. It would be a huge move forward for my career and would almost certainly be a substantial increase in salary.

On top of that, my partner and I had a baby about half a year ago, which obviously makes Victoria attractive in some ways. It seems far more likely we could find a two or three-bedroom rental in our price range in Victoria. Hell, we might even be able to afford to buy something! (Although I would probably rent for the first year regardless, to get a feel for the city and what neighbourhoods we like).

But here's the thing. I'm scared to leave behind our lives in Vancouver. We've worked very hard to establish ourselves in this city, having moved here from Ontario with basically nothing. We now both have decent jobs, but more importantly, we have a wonderful quality of life. We love the beaches, the mountains, the parks, the food. Obviously housing affordability puts a big damper on things, but overall, it really is an incredible place to live.

My question is for ex-Vancouverites who have made the move to Victoria: what do you miss? What don't you miss? Do the pros outweigh the cons? Do you ever regret the move or think of moving back? I'm looking for brutal honesty here as I contemplate a major life decision. I feel like I'm at a fork in the road and I'm unsure which path to take. Victoria is beautiful, but it does seem a bit sleepy and doesn't seem to have quite the same beach culture (we currently live in the West End and spend a lot of our days at English Bay or cycling the seawall).

I'd love your thoughts.

They advertise themselves as a 'quality' local-builder that cares about the community they live in...clearly they want nothing to do with the community they build in once their homes are sold.

My grandfather recently passed and we found that he had kept everything that was related to the wedding he had to my grandmother (she passed over 20 years ago). There was a newspaper clipping about their wedding with the headline ""H.P Youth marries"", but the article didn't state what the H.P. stood for. They married in Victoria in 1954. 

So any idea what it could've stood for? Neighborhood? A youth Society? I don't think its a neighborhood because that would strange for that to be in the headline for one person.  Maybe a highschool? Any suggestions? A google search is proving to be tough!

VictoriaBC,veronicacrank,"Moving to Sooke My husband and I are starting at looking to buy a place and we are thinking about Sooke as the real estate prices are just going up and up.  We have 2 young kids, the oldest will be starting school next year so we are really trying to find a place to put down roots (even if temporary) and I am a stay at home mum.  Husband works downtown but he is able to work from home exclusively.

Can anyone tell me what it's like living out there?  I grew up on the Saanich Peninsula (living in a variety of places since I moved out, including downtown Vancouver, the interior and the UK) and Sooke is a big blind spot to me.  I've only been to Sooke like 3 times in my life.  When we were out there yesterday looking at properties, we got stuck for 40 minutes because of a tree that fell down on some power lines, so I'm guessing it's not that great when there is a storm and probably happens quite frequently?  I have heard on the radio about the road getting closed when it floods.  What part floods?  What is out there for young families?  

Ideally, we are looking at Langford/Colwood but we don't want to exclude Sooke when the prices are much more attractive out there.  Has anyone built in Sunriver?  They've got lots for sale at the moment for $185k and I'm guessing around $300k to actually build the house so $485k for a custom house is super attractive to me.

Where are you?

How are connections formed in this city, or is everyone already connected?

I don't smoke, I don't do drugs, I have manners, I know how to treat a woman, and by that I mean that I won't psychologically abuse you or belittle you and most importantly, I won't hit you. I'm 26 years old, 6'1 and 193. I have a job, and yes I may be a little old for someone trying to finnish college, but I think its fair to say that I've lived a different life than most.

I don't want to hook up, I want romance. I want to find someone I can buy flowers for. I want someone I can I can write love letters for and then hide them under your pillow. I want that ""oh so amazing feeling"" when we smile at each other. I want to be excited about coming home to you or you coming home to me.

I know what relationships are like, they can be easy at times, they can be hard at times, but they can also be oh so amazing all the time! Life is the sum of our experiences and I want to experience getting to know someone. Not just their likes and dislikes, but who they are. 

Walking and talking, your hobby or mine. A relationship is about two people coming together, give and take. I don't want you to be someone else because you want to impress me, and you shouldn't expect me to be someone else to impress you. We can each share in what the other person loves, because after all won't that give you a better idea of who that person is?

I play sports, and I would play sports every day of the year if I could. Give me a basketball, baseball, street hockey ball, soccer ball, football, volleyball, tennis ball and I can be entertained for hours. I enjoy walks through Oak Bay, the sound of wind as whips past the plethora of interesting houses. I enjoy bike rides and lunches in the park. I'm and animal person, cats, dogs, love birds, I've owned them all. I'm somewhat a people person, I can be shy and outgoing, open and honest. I don't play video games, but that doesn't mean I don't like to play video games. TV is a good friend, but so are my books. I actually think I'm pretty diverse, and hard to pigeonhole.

I come from a good family, that is both small and large. I know the meaning ""family first"". I have some of the best friends a guy could ask for, they were their for me when I needed them the most.

Recently I (23, F) moved into a new building with my roommate and a much older man moved into the same building with his much much older dad the same month. We are next door neighbours. Since I moved in, May 1st, he always happened to run into me and I assumed it was a coincidence. Now mid-May, it’s no longer a coincidence because every time I get to my building he’s there coming in. Every time I leave my apartment door, he leaves his and comes into the elevator with me.

He’s been asking me a lot of personal questions: where I work, where I’m moving to, when I’m moving, if I drive or bus, what I do for work. Initially when I moved in, I answered some general questions as I thought he was just being friendly and making small talk, but I have started lying and giving false information now. Tonight, my roommate and I were having a discussion about her having work tonight, while in our apartment. We were using normal toned voices while talking, and we were not being loud enough for our next door neighbours to hear. We also know that the apartments are well noise proofed since we do not hear our neighbours talking on either side of us. I went into the smoke pit later and he just happened to leave his apartment at the same time again and followed me to the smoke pit and asked, “hey, are you working tonight?” The only way he must’ve heard is from listening in with his ear to the wall or something, since again we were not being loud when talking and we don’t hear either of our neighbours, so I am concerned on how he knew that. The patio door wasn’t open or any windows. His much older dad also joined us at the smoke pit to converse and I am very uncomfortable at that point. I decided to leave shortly after when I was left alone with his dad, and as I was walking back to my building I saw his dad start to follow me back to the building, even though he was still smoking when I left him. I started to walk fast and beat him to my building and elevator and got to my apartment before he got in. 

&#x200B;

This situation prompted me to not want to stay at home tonight, as I wanted to be on the safe side, and I felt he was asking “if I was working tonight” to confirm if I’ll be home alone tonight, with my roommate having work overnight and not being at home. When my roommate and I were leaving our apartment that night, we heard him once again, leave his apartment at the same time since he opened his door and we heard it as it was our neighbours door, but he took the stairs instead of the elevator. When we got to the main floor of the building, we heard someone open the side stairway door but not come out onto the main floor. I have no idea who that was, but I felt it was him coming down to check that my roommate was leaving to work for the night. 

&#x200B;

Another time, he asked me if my family was visiting. I said that was my roommate and her friend that came over and he told me he met them. I later asked my roommate if she met the next door neighbour and she said that she’s never met anyone in the building and no one has seen her going into our apartment. She was wondering how he knew she lived there with me as she’s never seen him. 

&#x200B;

There potentially could be a camera but I have no idea of this. This is just a theory as one of the first days I moved in, he volunteered to help me carry my groceries and wanted to see into my apartment and come in, but I told him to leave them at the door. Our apartment is facing the path I use to come home, so I’m just guessing that he watches me coming back home and leaves his apartment to come back in with me. 

&#x200B;

This man makes me very uncomfortable and he’s shown a lot of suspicious behaviour and timing. I have seen him following me behind me while I’m going to the smoke pit. I had to leave my apartment for the night because I felt unsafe from him and the comment he made and I’m afraid that he will continue to follow me and be creepy. Am I overreacting or am I right for feeling unsafe? I’m not sure if this is credible enough to report him?

&#x200B;

TLDR: My apartment neighbour, a much older man, has shown tons of suspicious timing and behaviour: follows me, just happens to always come in/leave apartment when I am, etc. and left me feeling unsafe. Do I report him?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for all the responses! I’m moving at the end of the month. I also bought some pepper spray and let my building manager know so that’s it’s filed, but I’m not reporting him right now just so nothing gets escalated or he gets mad, and I can continue monitoring and recording the situation.

The biggest challenge now is when to move out, as I don’t want him to see me moving.

VictoriaBC,victoriousvalkyrie,"A wintertime plea from your friendly neighbourhood delivery driver! Hey folks. As daylight savings has ended, the holiday season is fast approaching, and it's now darker out earlier, I have a little PSA for any person using food delivery services or online shopping during the winter (or during dark hours in general) that will make everyone happy and keep everyone safe. (For context, I do food delivery on a few of the apps)

1. *Please*, for the love of god, put your porch and/or pathway lights on! I would say more often than not, I'm delivering to dark porches. Please be aware that walking up to a dark house is a occupational hazard, and there's no excuse to not flick the porch light on or any outside lights that can be helpful with navigation. Also, one trip (especially during icy winter) and a) that's a potential lawsuit for you, and a potential life-altering/threatening injury for your driver and b) there goes your food/fragile Christmas shopping. The number of times I need to use my phone flashlight to complete a delivery is truly shameful.

2. When it's dark out, I can't see about 75% of your addresses if you live in a SFH, duplex, rowhouse, etc. The only ones I have no trouble finding are if they're huge numbers in black on a white/pale coloured house and/or backlit. I rely heavily on the app to tell me exactly which house I'm delivering to, and sometimes I have to run up and down the street between 3 houses because people don't have an address on their house at all, or because it's not visible at all. It means I have to guesstimate between the other addresses on the street whilst referencing the app for positioning. I know that sounds ridiculous, but go walk down your street at night in the middle of the road (where you would be driving) and just try looking for the addresses yourself. You'll be amazed at how difficult some can be to find. Please, place your address in a better position on the house (beside the front door or over the garage is best for most houses if it's not a fancy driveway sign), use contrasting, large font numbers, or better yet, if you know that you can't see your address in the dark, just note something really quick in your directions: ""Red Ford F150 in driveway"" or ""house with yellow front door"" helps a lot. FYI, Amazon sells backlit numbers and address plaques for very reasonable prices.

Since financial times are rough right now, and I have no opportunity for a raise at my full-time (unionized) job, I picked this up as a side gig and I honestly find it really enjoyable. Unfortunately, the two above mentioned things have made me almost quit numerous times, just because I worry about falling on dark stairs or not being able to find someone's house.

We use it as a second car and have generally found it to be cost effective and mostly convenient. Customer service has always been hit or miss - it’s often hard to reach someone if an issue arises and when you do, they may be super helpful or treat you like an idiot. 

I’m thinking about switching to EVO because of yet another negative experience with Modo’s customer service team and I’ve had enough. I interacted with 3 people, all of whom treated me like I was a major inconvenience and a total dummy. 

Has anyone else switched? How’s it going?

TLDR: additional info and question:

My modo issue this time around was that the car battery drained when I parked and turned off the car (a Prius C) to make a call before continuing on to an important meeting. I did not think to turn off the headlights during my stop. I made a call and tried to restart after about 3 mins and the car wouldn’t start. There was an engine light and a locked light showing on the dash. Confused and in a rush, I tried everything I could think of to fix the issue and then called a taxi and modo. 

After I finished the meeting, which I was late for, I followed up with modo and was told I had drained the battery and would be charged $150. I tried to explain that I didn’t think this was possible and asked them to review. Several emails later and they’ve said I was stopped for 8 minutes, which was long enough to drain the battery because I left the headlights on. I’ve been a driver for over 30 years (ouch that stings) and have never drained a battery in such a short time.

VictoriaBC,viewroyal_royal,"Catherine Holt: Regional traffic solution is right in front of us (TC) (Catherine Holt is the CEO of the Greater Victoria Chamber of Commerce)

When is the last time you complained about traffic? Driving home from up-Island on Sunday? Trying to park downtown in the middle of the day? This morning on your commute from Bear Mountain?

There’s no shortage of talk about how bad traffic is in our region. There’s also no shortage of ideas to improve things: Use the E&N corridor for buses, start a ferry from the Inner Harbour to Royal Bay, get more people living downtown so they won’t need cars, attract employers to the West Shore so workers won’t drive so far.

What we do fall short on is governance. There is no regional transportation entity that can set priorities, fund them and make them happen.

The Capital Regional District tried to create a regional transportation service. In March, the latest plan was defeated and the idea put on hold. It wasn’t a surprise.

The CRD doesn’t have the revenue sources or expertise to run regional transportation. And, as demonstrated by the outcome of this proposal, it is often thwarted by its own poor governance design. Board members tend to act for the communities that elected them rather than the region.

It’s time to move on and take a more realistic, proven approach to solving our region’s transportation issues.

Thankfully, we don’t have to look any further than the Victoria Regional Transit Commission, which does a fantastic job of quietly running our bus system.

Created by the provincial government as part of B.C. Transit’s services, the commission is composed of seven elected municipal representatives.

They are appointed by the province to act on behalf of the whole region.

The commission is effective because it has a local government perspective without squabbling over how to cut the pie into 13 pieces.

Commissioners make decisions in the region’s interest, and no community can opt out of the service or the funding required to run it.

So we have one bus system connecting our many communities — not three or six or 13.

The transit commission is also successful because it can get the revenue it needs. It determines the budget required, and individual municipalities must pay their share. That’s bolstered by a sizable grant from the provincial government and by a legislated regional gas tax, also from the province.

As well, the commission’s geographic boundaries make sense for our region’s transit users, as opposed to the borders of the CRD, which includes large rural areas, as well as Gulf Islands.

So, we have a model that works for buses, but could it work for other transportation challenges?

I think it would. In order for the bus system to function, the transit commission already works on high-level transportation issues, such as bus lanes from downtown to the West Shore, potential transit uses for the E&N corridor, and ways to reduce traffic and keep buses affordable through denser housing near transit hubs. But it can’t make those things happen; it has to persuade local governments to let it do them.

The next step is for the provincial government to give the commission the power to do those things. Our region is heavily represented in government. Surely our local MLAs understand the urgency for Greater Victoria commuters.

By scaling up the role and capacity of the transit commission, and renaming it a transportation commission, we could have a well-governed and effective agency capable of tackling regional traffic, starting with better road design, land use and infrastructure. And it could focus on outcomes, such as reducing commute times and carbon emissions, and increasing transit ridership.

If you’re still not convinced, consider these questions:

1. Is it possible the Johnson Street Bridge replacement project would have been more expertly managed, fairly funded and quickly delivered if it were a project owned and run by the region through the commission rather than just one city?

2. Would we have fewer bottlenecks if proper standards were set on a designated regional major road network — space for buses, standard speed limits, ability to accommodate all modes of travel?

3. Would bus lanes from downtown to the West Shore take fewer years to complete if there were one authority to decide to do them and fund and operate them, rather than having to deal with many jurisdictions?

If you answered yes, then ask yourself: Isn’t it time to embrace this sensible and proven solution to our region’s growing traffic troubles?","Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , Community Plan to End Homelessness , Sooke Transition House Society",0,True,0.0

VictoriaBC,viewroyal_royal,"Les Leyne: Horgan puts brakes on light rail for E&N (TC Column) Premier John Horgan not only dashed the hopes of light-rail transit fans in the capital region on Tuesday, he got a nice round of applause for doing so.

Addressing the 400-member massed forces of all the local chambers of commerce, Horgan parked the light-rail dream in short order.
“The business case doesn’t seem to be there.”

He signalled his government is vastly more interested in bus lanes. Watch for plans to extend them much farther than the construction that’s already underway.


It’s a bit of an about-face. The NDP in opposition made some polite remarks over the years about the potential for rapid transit on the abandoned E&N Railway line. It came with the job of nagging government to do more of everything when it came to transportation. But dithering over that potential has occupied dreamers for years.

Now that they’re in power, Horgan said, he has been talking to leaders about using the corridor for its purpose, “which is not necessarily a train, but moving people from the west into the city and back again.”

Referring to the never-ending talk of light rail, he said: “I’m not prepared to wait any longer. We shouldn’t have a corridor like that designated for just growing Scotch broom.”

The ramshackle Dayliner passenger service that formerly used the line was mothballed seven years ago, and the rail line has been rotting ever since, while a bustling bike path occupies part of the right-of-way.

Horgan wasn’t specific, but insisted the corridor should be used to move people. “I’m committed to doing that, and that will happen.”

People are wasting time in congestion, and Horgan said his government is keen to build a transportation plan for the south Island.

Bus lanes are an “immediate and efficient” solution to gridlock.

It went over well with the crowd packed into Crystal Garden.

But the elephant in the room was the employer health tax. Business leaders have concentrated attention on the downside of eliminating Medical Services Plan premiums ever since the move was made in the February budget.

Its partial replacement is a phased-in payroll tax that imposes new costs on employers, particularly those that didn’t cover employees’ MSP premiums.

And those who do will sustain a double hit next year, paying one more year of their workers’ premiums in addition to the new tax.

Horgan reminded them that he campaigned against the MSP, although the replacement came to light only in the budget. “We said were going to do it and we are doing it.”

He said he knows the replacement is a significant concern. “We understand. We feel your pain.”

He pointed to upcoming cuts to the sales tax on electricity bills as a partial offset.

But the first question after his speech was a plea to reassess the impact of the tax, given how it hits municipal employers, as well, and that impact compounds on business property taxes.

To paraphrase, the answer was: No.

The Finance Ministry is scrambling to soften the impact on some sectors, such as non-profits and school districts. But municipalities and businesses aren’t on the list and won’t be any time soon.

Horgan said the property-tax impact of municipalities passing their tax costs on to property owners is “infinitesimal” compared to the savings for individuals (assuming their premiums weren’t covered by their employers).

Horgan said the NDP’s payroll tax will be the lowest in the country, is being phased in, and makes B.C. the last place in Canada to abandon the flat-rate premiums.

“This is what rest of the country is doing. This is catching up to the rest of the country.”

It wasn’t what they wanted to hear, but Horgan held his own, overall.

The antipathy over the tax is partly offset by the sheer novelty of having a premier from the capital, with a select handful of cabinet misters from the ’hood as well.

The crowd is counting on a bump in provincial spending locally as an offshoot of that representation.

If Horgan can hold the employer health tax anger to a simmer, rather than a boil, he can count that as a win.",front line worker,0,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,viewroyal_royal,"New day for Swartz Bay terminal: ideas B.C. Ferries is considering  [https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/new-day-for-swartz-bay-terminal-ideas-b-c-ferries-is-considering-1.23450302](https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/new-day-for-swartz-bay-terminal-ideas-b-c-ferries-is-considering-1.23450302)

B.C. Ferries wants to upgrade the terminal so that it can handle more traffic and to make it “a more efficient and pleasurable experience for customers.”

“We don’t expect construction for the new terminal to begin until about 2021,” said B.C. Ferries spokeswoman Tessa Humphries.

She said there is no cost estimate so far. “We don’t have a final plan, so there’s been no budget established for the work.”

B.C. Ferries sought suggestions in Phase 1 of its public consultation and produced design concepts based on those suggestions in Phase 2. It’s now heading to Phase 3, which will see more detailed plans developed by the end of the year.

The park is envisioned as a spot with amenities such as a covered market, coffee kiosk and food trucks. There was support for adding a boardwalk. “Looks like a nice space for everyone including pets and wheelchairs,” one person wrote to B.C. Ferries. Another suggested covered seating for hot or rainy weather.

More than 500 people have given their opinions, participating online, at pop-up events and at stakeholder and employee workshops.

Other possibilities include an expanded foot-passenger building and improved pick-up and drop-off facilities.

“They were asked: ‘Do these options meet your needs? What would you prefer? What would you like to see?’ ” said Humphries.

While Phase 3 will produce a development proposal, “it is important to note that that concept, when it’s released, is still a draft,” Humphries said. “It’s not a final plan. We need to move into the detailed-design portion of terminal redevelopment, which will have further public engagement, before we actually start on construction and final design.”

Other ideas that have been pitched include a pub and lounge in the terminal, a basketball court, better bicycling facilities, more places for pets, better food options, better Wi-Fi, and a covered area for people waiting for buses.

Swartz Bay terminal is the second busiest in the B.C. Ferries system behind Tsawwassen and has more than seven million passengers a year going through it.

The terminal was opened in 1930 and sits on 22.7 hectares.

Improvements over the years include the 1959 addition of the Lands End Café building, the building of a control tower in 1992, revamping of the terminal building in the mid-1990s and expansion of vehicle waiting areas in 2007.",Community Plan to End Homelessness ,0,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,viewroyal_royal,"New graving dock gets city OK, jobs to follow (TC) A new $50-million-plus graving dock to be built at Point Hope Marine shipyard near the new Johnson Street Bridge was given the green light by Victoria councillors Thursday.

Once completed, the graving dock will mean another 200 high-paying jobs at the shipyard in addition to the 200 already there.

“Those are well-paid jobs that can pay the mortgage. A labourer in our shipyard is earning, including his benefits, just under $90,000 and skilled trades they take home between $110,000 and $130,000 a year,” said Point Hope Marine general manager Riccardo Regosa.

“It’s a very, very significant investment,” said Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps.


“We see lots of $50-million investments in the downtown. We see new buildings going up everywhere and that’s awesome and that investment is totally welcome. This investment is the kind of investment that is going to have a long-term payoff,” Helps said.

Ralmax Group of Companies plans to build the graving dock at its shipyard, at 203-211 Harbour Road in Victoria West.

It will be capable of servicing vessels up to 170 metres (560 feet) in length and six-metre draft.

Regosa said the new dry dock will enable the shipyard to service most Royal Canadian Navy and Canadian Coast Guard vessels as well as most B.C. Ferries vessels.

“I think with our dock we will be well positioned to provide services to all three of them in the future. So I expect those will be part of our client base,” Regosa said.

Prior to start of construction, Ralmax will need approval from a number of agencies, including Transport Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the provincial Ministry of Environment. Once approvals are granted, construction will take 18 to 24 months.

Helps said Ralmax needs the development permit before getting provincial and federal government approvals.

“Now they can go forward to Ottawa and say, ‘Hey look, the local government is supportive and now Ottawa needs to take those steps. So it’s a very significant milestone today,” Helps said.

Coun. Ben Isitt said industrial use of the site is appropriate as long as activities there do not interfere with “use and enjoyment” for city residents — particularly people living elsewhere in Victoria West and downtown.

Isitt said Ralmax has a good track record, but the city might consider tightening up regulations to ensure residential interests are protected.

“Certainly if the property ever changed hands [there might be a concern], he said. “We deal all the time with nightclubs that are run very well and we never get complaints. Then there’s nightclubs that are run very irresponsibly and we have constant complaints. Presumably the same thing can happen with the shipyard.”

The new graving dock is to be built largely within the existing footprint of the shipyard, and will not affect the navigable marine channel.

All of the work is to be done near the water’s edge. No new buildings are in the plan, and no changes are expected on the Harbour Road frontage. No rezoning is required.

Victoria councillors, sitting as a committee of the whole, unanimously approved the development permit. The decision still has to be ratified by council.

The new graving dock is expected to allow the shipyard to attract one large vessel every three weeks. Ships would remain at the shipyard for one to three months.

Ralmax acquired the shipyard in 2003 and shut it down for three years to undertake a $20-million upgrade that included:

• A water catchment and treatment system.

• A change in the camber of the property so that surface water flows away from the harbour and into catchment drains.

• Hard capping of the shipyard surface.

• Construction of a marine railway system and a marine turntable.

Since 2006, no water has been discharged from the shipyard into the harbour; all water used at the shipyard and all stormwater is treated on site.

VictoriaBC,wanderforhelp,"Hat stolen on the Goose :( I was running my regular route on the Goose today at dusk when an owl stole my hat! It swooped in from behind me and grabbed it off my head (terrifying) and then sat in a tree and chewed on it for awhile before flying away.

It has a lot of sentimental value and is proving tough to replace as it's discontinued. The incident occurred on the Goose between Tolmie and the Gorge near the path to Alpha Street and I'm hoping it'll turn up nearby. I'll be out looking tomorrow morning!

Me and my boyfriend currently live in Alberta. My boyfriend wants to go to Uvic, and he is not budging on that decision. That's what he wants and there's no going back for him on his decision.

I really love him. He's my partner, and I am willing to move with him anywhere he wants. However, there's a limit to that: I'm NOT going to go in debt for anything or anyone. We visited Victoria recently for a vacation, and I really enjoyed it. I have no problem moving...if it weren't for not knowing how to survive without sinking into debt. 

Maybe getting an apartment for just us two is stretching it too far. I have a relatively low-paying career path (slightly above minimum), and he's living of off student loans in university. 

But maybe there's another way to live in Victoria without breaking out the credit cards? 

Do people generally rent out basements for cheaper? Does Uvic offer any kind of living space for a student and non-student? There must be something we can do to make living in Victoria affordable enough. 

How do your living situations look like? 


Thank you.


EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone who commented! I didn't expect so many answers. You're all awesome people! My boyfriend and I review every answer. It definitely helps us understand the situation in Victoria better, and it'll help us figure out moving better if we actually do go through with the move.

In light of everything that is going on in the US right now, a non-white friend of mine just brought this to my attention:

""Totally random...as I'm reading the continued news of gun/race issues in USA...in our last days in Victoria we were hanging out etc and I noticed it the first time and then the second time with my husband....at Fisherman's Wharf there are all those private boat houses....the last house on one of those docks has a rocking chair outside it, in public view, with a dummy dressed in a KKK hat and outfit. I found it utterly shocking. Is there anything that can be done about it?? I don't think I took a pic. I can check. But I don't think the owner is apologetic at all about it. It was the same display weeks apart from first time to second time I saw it.""

I was wondering if anyone has any more information about this. Should u/VicPDCanada be informed? I recognize that I may have passed this and not noticed it before, but I haven't been out to the end of the docks in at least a couple of years. My friend lived here for a year and work has now taken her family out of the country and just brought it up now, but as I mentioned in earlier, in light of everything happening in the states (and in Canada with BLM and Toronto Pride), I would want to make sure that people are not confronted with this anywhere, let alone while living in or visiting our city.

VictoriaBC,weplayfunerals,"City of Victoria rushing through community boundary changes (Oaklands, Fernwood, North Park, Burnside, etc.) I have not seen much discussion about this so am guessing most residents have no idea it's occurring.

I attended a community association meeting earlier this month where it became known that the city is wanting to push through community boundary changes with arguably minimal meaningful consultation and 2 month deadline.

The crux of the city's argument appears to be that the current community boundaries do not match their ""villages and corridors"" plan.  Instead of designing their plan around what exists on the ground they want to redo the community boundaries to match sim city style.

A map was shown at the meeting but so far I have not been able to find any public version of it.  The best I can offer is this summary of the resolutions from the relevant city meeting.

2.

3. That Council direct staff to engage the Fairfield-Gonzales Community Association, the Downtown Residents Association, and the Downtown Victoria Business Association regarding the potential recognition of the 800-blocks between Fort Street and Academy Close, and Blanshard Street and Quadra Street, as part of the Downtown neighbourhood, requesting comment from those associations by April 30, 2021.
4. That Council direct staff to engage the Burnside-Gorge Community Association, the Downtown Residents Association, and the Downtown Victoria Business Association regarding the potential adjustment of the boundary between Burnside-Gorge and Downtown from Chatham/Discovery/Caledonia to Bay Street, so that Bay Street would become the northern boundary of Downtown and the southern boundary of Burnside-Gorge, requesting comment from those associations by April 30, 2021.
5. That Council direct staff to engage the South Jubilee Neighbourhood Association and the North Jubilee Neighbourhood Association regarding the potential recognition of a unified Jubilee neighbourhood and their thoughts on how one CALUC could potentially be formed to service the one new unified neighbourhood, requesting comment from those associations by April 30, 2021.
6. That Council direct staff to engage the Downtown Residents Association and the Downtown Victoria Business Association regarding the potential recognition of Downtown and Harris Green as a unified Downtown neighbourhood, requesting comment from that association by April 30, 2021.
7. That Council direct staff to engage the Victoria Community Association Network regarding these proposed adjustments to neighbourhood boundaries, requesting comment from VCAN and any neighbourhood association that wishes to provide comment by April 30, 2021.
8. That Council direct staff to engage with North Park Neighbourhood Association and the Fernwood Community Association regarding the potential adjustment that would make Chambers Street the eastern boundary of North Park and the western boundary of Fernwood between Bay and Pandora.
9. That proposed neighbourhood boundary changes, that coincide with current local area planning (i.e. Village and Corridor Planning: Fernwood, North Park, Hillside- Quadra), be included in the local area planning engagement, taking into consideration the end date of engagement as suggested in the neighbourhood boundaries report.

VictoriaBC,westcoastbestcoast9_,"Saanich-Gulf Islands MP Elizabeth May steps down as Green Party Leader OTTAWA – Elizabeth May has announced she has stepped down as leader of the Green Party, but will stay on as leader in Parliament.

May said she wanted to choose her own time in going, at a time when the party had momentum, and has named her interim replacement: Jo-Ann Roberts, who until today was deputy leader of the party.

She made this announcement after meeting with her two other caucus colleagues on Parliament Hill today: Green MPs Paul Manly, and Jenica Atwin.

In various interviews with CTV News since the election, May — who has been leader of the party since 2006 — has spoken candidly about the unlikelihood that she’s still be at the helm of the party by the next scheduled federal election in 2023, though with the nature of minority parliaments it’s possible that the next campaign will kick off before then.

She recently mused about running for House of Commons Speaker, but for now she won’t be doing that, saying she’d like to run for speaker after the next election.

May intends to stay on as the member of Parliament for Saanich-Gulf Islands

May had previously said she wanted to make the decision about her future in lockstep with Atwin and Manly, adding that she would rather go out after delivering the party’s “best results ever,” and that a new leader and leadership race could reinvigorate the party.

An automatic leadership review was scheduled to take place in the spring, but with her stepping aside now there will be a formal leadership vote next October.

Greens now caucus of three

In advance of their meeting, May tweeted that it was a “historic day” for her party.

Manly was first elected to represent Nanaimo-Ladysmith, B.C. in a 2019 byelection, and Atwin gained her seat in the 2019 election. As the MP-elect for Fredericton, N.B. Atwin is the first Green MP to be elected to represent a riding outside of British Columbia and some have speculated she’d be an ideal replacement for May.

In a press release, the Green Party said that the climate emergency is their caucus’ top priority, but they will also be pressing the prime minister to follow through on his 2015 promise of electoral reform, and be pushing for improvements to health care, affordability for seniors and students, and advancing Indigenous reconciliation.

May entered the 2019 federal election campaign hoping that her experience, the uptick in support for her party — with voters in four provinces electing more Greens to provincial legislatures than ever before — and a renewed focus on climate change as a ballot box issue would result in more Green MPs winning seats.

In the end, that momentum did not translate into big gains, with the surge of the Bloc Quebecois relegating the NDP to fourth-party status and keeping the Greens in fifth, but with one more seat and securing more than a million votes Canada-wide.

Now, the focus is on the potential power the caucus of three could have in the Liberal minority parliament. In her address from Victoria, B.C., on election night May said she was confident that the Greens will be able to have a “really significant” role.

Though, with the Liberals just 13 seats short of a majority Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has options on both sides of the ideological spectrum to garner support to prop his government up.

While the three Green votes could be important to secure, the party is not likely to be in the position of playing kingmaker in the months ahead. The Prime Minister’s office has confirmed that he has scheduled meetings with the leaders of all opposition party leaders to be held in Ottawa next week.

May at helm for over a decade

May has publicly offered up her leadership role at various points over her tenure, including when she offered to give up her leadership to former cabinet ministers Jody Wilson-Raybould—who was since reelected as an Independent—and Jane Philpott after they were dismissed from the Liberal caucus in April.

May was first elected to represent the Vancouver Island riding of Saanich-Gulf Islands, B.C. in 2011, as the first ever Green Party MP. Aside from raising the issue and impact of climate change, May has used her voice in the House of Commons to implore her colleagues to cut down on heckling and improve the level of civility.

For the 17 years before she was the leader, May was the executive director of the Sierra Club non-profit environmental advocacy group. Born in Connecticut, May moved to Nova Scotia with her parents as a teenager. Her family gave up their home there a few years later to fund a fight against plans to spray the province's forests with Agent Orange. In the 1980s, she worked as an adviser to the environment minister of then-prime minister Brian Mulroney. She went on a 17-day hunger strike in 2001 to call attention to toxic waste in the Sydney Tar Ponds.

May turned 65 in June, which makes her the oldest election-time leader of a major national party since Paul Martin in 2006.

VictoriaBC,westcoastbestcoast9_,"Victoria councillors want plan that keeps some COVID-19 measures, such as free transit (Copied from TC - Paywalled) 

Lindsay Kines / Times Colonist
MAY 14, 2020 06:00 AM

A group of Victoria city councillors is urging support for a regional plan that retains and builds on some of the COVID-19 response measures, such as free public transit and emergency aid for people without homes.
Councillors Ben Isitt, Jeremy Loveday, Sarah Potts and Sharmarke Dubow want council to endorse a policy statement developed in recent weeks by Common Vision, Common Action, a coalition of community, religious, labour and environmental groups.

Isitt, who sat on the group’s policy committee, said participants were inspired by people’s compassion and co-operation in response to the pandemic and the associated economic crisis.

“There were also people looking at the ecological benefits of the shutdown in terms of taking some of the pressure off of natural ecosystems and lightening the footprint of humanity on the planet,” he said. “So the idea coalesced of advocating for a caring and low-carbon region after COVID-19.”

The resulting document, Moving Forward, Not Backward, advocates retaining a number of COVID-19 response measures to deal with other ongoing crises, such as climate change, inequality, drug overdoses and the impacts of colonization on Indigenous peoples.

Among the proposed actions:

• keeping the current fare-free public transit program in place on a trial basis for one year and deploying the B.C. Transit fleet with maximum service hours

• permanently converting some of the motels, hotels and short-term rental units in the region to residential housing with supports

• maintaining access to safer prescription alternatives to street drugs, along with increased investment in detox, treatment and recovery services

• expanding municipal support for food production on public and private land, including distributing soil, plants and other gardening materials

• pressing the federal and provincial governments to bring in a wealth tax, withhold regulatory approval for all new fossil-fuel projects and halt the Trans-Mountain and Coastal Gaslink projects

Jenn Neilson, a member of the policy committee and a director of the HQ Collective in the Hillside-Quadra neighbourhood, said Victoria council will discuss the regional policy agenda today, but it’s hoped other municipalities will review and endorse the plan as well.
She said COVID-19 has shown what communities and governments can accomplish for people in need and for the environment.

“I think for so long, we were told that much of this is impossible, but actually, it turns out it’s just a matter of priorities more than anything else,” she said. “And I think a lot of people are realizing, both personally and societally, that maybe the priorities that we had before weren’t benefiting everybody quite as much as we thought and were maybe leaving some people behind.”

Neilson said a number of community, environmental and religious organizations are backing the project, including KAIROS Victoria, a multi-faith coalition working on peace and justice issues.
Grace Draper, co-ordinator with KAIROS Victoria, said the policy statement dovetails nicely with the organization’s name, which derives from an ancient Greek word for a moment in time when change is possible.

“I love that word, because I really do believe — and a lot of people have come to the conclusion — that we are at a kairos moment about a lot of issues,” she said. “Not just dealing with this virus, but it’s forcing us to assess the political, the economic, the environment, our own personal lives — all of it and how it’s all interconnected.

“There’s an opportunity here. Change is possible.”
Victoria council will consider the policy statement at its committee of the whole meeting today.

VictoriaBC,westcoastgear,"Starting March 8, 2021 at 7am PT the Discover Camping website and call center will begin accepting front county and back country reservations. Got an email with the announcement and made a (very) quick summery. Just got an email From Parks BC and wanted to share a couple highlights for those looking to get out camping this year. These are taken directly from the email and are  only some of the highlights. ( source at the bottom)

 

**Priority Access for British Columbians**

·        Due to the ongoing pandemic, **British Columbians will be provided with priority access to camping reservations until July 7** – ensuring they have first access to the core season of reservations through to the end of summer. Starting July 8, non-residents of BC will be permitted to make reservations for any remaining arrival dates in the season, pending travel orders that may allow travel.

 

**Day Use Facilities, Picnic Shelters and Halls**

·        In order to meet PHO guidelines, reservations for day use facilities, including picnic shelters and halls remain closed for the 2021 season.

&#x200B;

**Non-residents of BC are still allowed in parks,**  
as travel orders permit, whether for day-use, for first-come first-served camping, and for reservations made after July 7th. However, the message remains to stay close to home and avoid non-essential travel.

VictoriaBC,westcoastsunflower,"Seeking advice on home care for elderly mom. My mom has been suffering from debilitating pain going on 3 weeks now. We’ve been to the hospital twice and you can imagine how that is going. The first time she gave up and left because she waited so long. The second time I had to call an ambulance as she was on the floor and I couldn’t get her up. Back to the hospital. Btw it took 2.5 hours to have the ambulance arrive. So she spent from 9pm to 9am at RJH without being seen/diagnosed and was told she may as well go home. 
So now  I am trying to find some decent part time at home care for her. I work Monday to Friday so can’t be here all the time. 
Would like to have a kind, caring person come in to help with chores mostly, make sure she eats etc. she’s 87 and lives in a retirement home but the only service they provide is weekly housecleaning. Finances are not an issue. She’s in the Esquimalt area. 
Anybody have any recommendations on a reputable organization? 
Thanks for any suggestions you can provide.

Edit to add that her first visit was VGH - she found it very confusing compared to RJH. Apparently she is .6 kms closer to VGH and ambulance drivers have to call for approval to take her to RJH.

UPDATE: I'm happy to say we met with Alistair from Home Instead today and we will have care by the end of the week. I showed him  the post and the responses I received and he was super surprised when he read all the responses lol. Definitely a newbie to Reddit.

VictoriaBC,westmost,"Ride-hailing policies set in B.C.; minimum fares to match taxis https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/ride-hailing-policies-set-in-b-c-minimum-fares-to-match-taxis-1.23920763

 Ride-hailing companies that want to operate in B.C. will have large operating areas and no limits on the size of their fleets, though they will not be allowed to charge any less than a comparable starting taxi fare, according to policies revealed Monday by the Passenger Transportation Board.

The board, which has jurisdiction over ride-hailing services — what it calls transportation network services or TNS in the province — said the limitless fleets and ability to operate beyond borders, which taxis are bound to respect, is part of the ride-hailing business model.

Board chairwoman Catharine Read said the boundaries need to be large enough for the business model to work, while their research suggests it will take years for companies such as Uber and Lyft to ramp up their fleet of vehicles and drivers, especially since B.C. requires operators to hold a Class 4 driver’s licence.

The board will also require ride-hailing firms to charge the same minimum rate as any taxi in the operating region.

In the Lower Mainland, that can range from $3.25 to $3.95. In Victoria, the three largest taxi firms charge a base rate of $3.30.

Read said the ride-hailing firms will be able to employ their dynamic pricing models.

“There is no cap on [ride-hailing] rates to allow them to increase prices to provide more drivers at peak times,” she said, adding passengers would be provided with an estimated cost for a trip up front.

There is also a requirement for ride-hailing operators to provide performance data from the day they start operating.

“The board will make evidence-based decisions based on data,” Read said, noting if there is evidence of congestion or other factors, it might affect future decisions on fleet sizes.

The board has set out five operating areas for the ride-hailing services: the Lower Mainland and Whistler, the capital region, the rest of Vancouver Island, Okanagan-Kootenay-Cariboo, and the rest of B.C.

The services can apply to operate in as many of those areas as they wish, though they will only be charged one application fee and one licence fee.

Taxi companies may also apply for a TNS licence, and when they are operating under it, the taxi would be subject to the same rules — including the flexibility to operate within defined ride-hailing boundaries.

 Read conceded that taxi services are not happy with policies that allow ride-hailing companies to cross boundaries, but she said they would not consider changing taxi boundaries at this point because it would require extensive consultation.

Mohan Kang, president of the Victoria-based B.C. Taxi Association, said ride-hailing is the biggest challenge the industry has ever faced and predicted it will be tough for some operators to survive.

“You do not flood the market, nobody gains anything then,” he said. “If there is no cap on TNS, it defeats the purpose. Their drivers won’t be able to make a living and our drivers won’t be able to make a living.”

He argues the board should have considered doing a pilot project with a limited number of drivers.

“That way, with the passage of time, they would have a better idea. If they need more [drivers], then give them more. If they don’t, then at least the damage would only be to the extent that has been granted,” he said.

Kang said thousands of families rely on taxi income, and two or three times that rely on the industry’s spending on repairs, insurance and the ripple effect through the community.

“We are very concerned about this issue,” he said.

The Passenger Transportation Board will begin accepting applications from ride-hailing companies on Sept. 3.

Read estimates it will take between six and eight weeks before any application is approved.

Peter Lukomskyj, general manager of Lyft in B.C., said his company saw wins and losses in the policies laid out by the board Monday.

“We appreciate the Passenger Transportation Board’s decision to establish an innovative model that does not include municipal boundaries and caps at this time,” he said. “While we are disappointed that the regulations do not include a provincial boundary, we are pleased that large geographic regions were taken into account.”

He said Lyft intends to eventually operate throughout the province, but he believes the Class 4 commercial licensing requirement will make it difficult to do so outside the Lower Mainland.

“We are committed to B.C. and will continue to work with the [Passenger Transportation Board] and the province to create the conditions for us to bring Lyft to the Lower Mainland before the end of the year, and to more regions throughout B.C. in the future,” he said.",Service provider ,1,False,8.333333333333332
VictoriaBC,westmost,"Victoria man dies in skydiving accident in Nanoose Bay https://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/victoria-man-dies-in-skydiving-accident-in-nanoose-bay-1.24165797


 A 34-year-old Victoria man died in a skydiving accident Sunday night in Nanoose Bay.

The experienced parachutist, identified by a friend as James (Jimmy) Smith, hit the ground while performing an advanced high-speed manoeuvre known as “swooping.”

Friend Mickey McLean said the death is a sad reminder of how dangerous the sport is. “But we, as skydivers, accept the risk.”

McLean said Smith has a wife and young daughter, and was a talented carpenter who loved riding his motorcycle. Smith started skydiving about 10 years ago in Vernon, he said.

Oceanside RCMP were called just before 7 p.m. and arrived to find the victim deceased, said RCMP Cpl. Chris Manseau.

Gord Gauvin, owner of Nanoose-based Skydive Vancouver Island, said the Island’s small skydiving community is grieving the loss of one of its own.

He said the experienced parachutist, with more than 1,000 skydives under his belt, was a coach and instructor in the sport and experienced with the “swooping” manoeuvre.

Gauvin said the force of the landing was “catastrophic.”

He told the Times Colonist that a number of people had come together Sunday, including customers and sport jumpers, for a typical weekend gathering at the Arbutus Meadows Event Centre.

He said skydivers are “a very tight, tight-knit group” and their friend “was a big part of that.”

Police co-operated with WorkSafe B.C., the Transportation Safety Board and the B.C. Coroners Service on the case, Manseau said.

The Canadian Sport Parachuting Association has also been notified.

Gauvin said the parachute association has a safety-management system that will be used to evaluate what happened.",Victoria Native Friendship Centre ,0,False,41.17647058823529

I recently had my brand new Macbook Air stolen out of the trunk of my car. I'll spare you the gritty details, however, before you write me off as a foolish person, know that this is the first time I've ever left my laptop in my vehicle. I am very careful about these things.

ANYWAY. I had my Macbook set to ping me when it is opened. It hadn't done so in the first 48 hours following being stolen but in the last twelve has pinged twice. I've called VicPD both times to update my file, the first time immediately upon notification to let them know the supposed location. The person on the phone advised me that the officers were very busy with other things last night--granted, understood that there are more pressing issues than stolen items--and that an officer would get back to me when able. The call never came. Again last night whilst I was sleeping I was alerted again to a new location. I called again this morning right away and the individual updated my file but really seemed quite non-plussed. 

I'm wondering what to do next. I get it. My laptop has been stolen, it's gone. I can and will get over it if it's not retrieved. It's just...frustrating to watch it seemingly slip through my fingers repeatedly. If it pings me again, I'm now considering going to the location myself. Obviously I will be exceptionally cautious and not engage with any individuals at the location but I would be hoping to get a visual or be able to perhaps discreetly take some photographs of potential thieves. 

&#x200B;

What would you all do? What do you recommend? Do any of you know the process on the VicPD end?

VictoriaBC,whytep,"More ""victims"" of the speculation tax. As it seems several people assume I am the one complaining here I have nothing to do with this article I just copy pasted from Times Colonist.  Hence why I put ""victims"" in  quotation marks and put the link to the article at the bottom. These are the entitled twats this tax was intended for. I have zero sympathy for them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My husband and I are Americans living seven months per year in Scottsdale, Arizona. Seventeen years ago, as we contemplated future retirement, we took a trip to Victoria and fell in love.

We knew we wanted a home there where we could spend five months per year and welcome friends and family throughout the year. We found our place in the Outer Harbour in 2007.

When we first learned about the two per cent speculation tax for foreign buyers, we thought we could rent our place for three months and that, added to our current arrangement, would exceed the stipulated six months stated in the new speculation tax.

However, we soon were informed that no, we are required to either be Canadian and living in our condo at least six months, or we are required to rent our condo for six months to be exempted from the two per cent tax.

After the housing bubble burst about 10 years ago, sending prices plummeting all over the U.S. and Canada, the market rebounded and housing prices have soared in the past few years. This is multi-factorial and not just a simplistic consequence of foreign buyers scooping up homes and leaving them vacant as purely an investment. Our home’s assessed value is now more than $1 million, which translates to a speculation tax of almost $21,000 per year, on top of the $5,600 in property tax every year.

As retirees and living on a fixed income, we simply cannot afford to pay the B.C. government $21,000 every year for an ill-conceived law that is clearly prejudicial and discriminatory, squarely aimed at foreigners and does nothing to fix the situation.

How does this truly translate to our situation? We bought our condo as our home. As we prepared for our retirement several years ago, we paid off our condo. We have close friends here now. Hundreds of our friends and family have visited Victoria over the past 12 years, contributing to the economy.

We have furnished our condo with the care and personal attention one uses to furnish a home — not a rental property. We have remodelled our condo from top to bottom with more than $100,000 in improvements over the past 12 years, money poured into the Victoria economy.

Along with our condo fees, property taxes and tens of thousands of dollars poured into the British Columbia coffers every year, we are clearly benefiting Victoria.

The government has basically stolen our home. At the end of every September, when we leave for the States, we are forced to pack up all personal effects and put them in a storage locker and then unpack it all again when we return in May. We will hope that no one has damaged or stolen our furnishings.

The goverment is forcing us to let strangers live in our home for six months, which is longer than my husband and I can live in our own home unless we cough up $21,000, plus the property tax, which is close to $27,000 a year.

We will likely be forced to sell our property at some point as this arrangement is not sustainable for us on a fixed income.

How is it fair to force someone to rent out one’s home? With this arrangement, we can’t even come to Victoria during the holiday season now because there will be renters in our home! How can this even be legal? It most certainly is not fair.

There were many things B.C. could have done to truly target the real speculators. Since the lion’s share of speculation has taken place in the past few years, an equitable solution would have been to grandfather those who have owned their property for more than five years.

Moreover, how does renting out a place for six months even help current B.C. residents? We could certainly extend our stay in Victoria for the six-month requirement (minus one day to conform to U.S. and Canadian regulations), but as foreigners, that will not work either.

What is even more ludicrous in this scenario is that the likely renters will be foreign!

How does the speculation tax keep homes affordable for B.C. residents and prevent them from going up in value? It doesn’t. This new law flies in the face of any type of logic or fairness and does nothing to address the issue that the law purportedly seeks to fix.

Forcing us to either pay $21,000 a year or rent out our home for six months is extortion and should never have been made into law.

Targeting foreigners flies in the face of everything I admire about Canadians.

Canada has admirably welcomed refugees from other countries, while pulling the rug out from under people who have lived in Canada for decades.

VICTORIA — Six homeowners have launched a legal challenge against British Columbia's speculation and vacancy tax, arguing the law is unconstitutional and the provincial government doesn't have the power to collect revenues from the levy.

The homeowners filed their petition Thursday in B.C. Supreme Court in Vancouver.

The lead petitioners are two Oak Bay residents, Denise Simpson, 72, and her husband Robert Simpson, 93. Four other homeowners from Metro Vancouver have joined the petition.

Lawyer Kailin Che, whose firm Lawrence Wong and Associates is representing the homeowners, says Denise Simpson is a Canadian citizen and has lived in her home since she was five. She inherited the home from her mother 20 years ago.

""In her words, it's the last piece of physical connection she has to her family, who have all passed away,"" Che said in an interview.

The Simpsons are joint owners of the property and both their names are on the property title, but Robert is a U.S. citizen, said Che. They live part of the year in Texas, where Robert receives a U.S. military pension, which under the speculation tax means the Simpsons are classified as a satellite family and that results in a $6,000 tax bill.

Under the tax, satellite families earn most of their income outside Canada.

""Denise is very Canadian but her husband happens to be American,"" Che said. ""He's a war veteran. They have certain connections to the States but that doesn't make her any less Canadian than you and I. But they're branded as a satellite family and consequently they are not eligible for any exemptions under the tax.""

The tax rate for 2018 was 0.5 per cent of a property's assessed value, rising to two per cent in 2019 for foreign owners and satellite families, while Canadian citizens or permanent residents continue to pay 0.5 per cent.

The tax is a major component of the New Democrat government's $6.5 billion plan to deliver 114,000 affordable homes over the next 10 years. The government said the speculation tax will target foreign and domestic real estate speculators, increase the amount of rental homes and provide revenue for housing initiatives.

Finance Minister Carole James said earlier this month the province collected $115 million from the tax in the 2018-19 fiscal year. She said 99.8 per cent of British Columbia residents were exempt from the tax.

James said in a statement Thursday she will not comment on the specifics of the Simpson case as it is likely heading to court.

""The speculation and vacancy tax is a key measure to tackle the housing crisis in B.C.'s major urban centres, and initial data shows the tax is working as intended,"" says her statement. ""As with any tax measure, ministry staff worked closely with legal experts in drafting the legislation.""

The court petition document says the only way for the Simpsons to avoid paying the tax, other than selling the home, is to rent it out to other people and find another home to rent themselves.

""In order to qualify for an exemption under the act, the retired pensioner intends to rent out her home,"" says the petition. ""The tax will cause the retired pensioner to rent out her home only to cause her to rent another one for herself and her spouse.""

VictoriaBC,whytep,"Victoria councillor asking B.C. for power to tax empty houses From TC article today - couldn't post link as it's paywall

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Victoria Coun. Ben Isitt is calling on the province to enable local governments to levy an empty-homes tax similar to Vancouver’s.

Isitt has introduced a motion to be discussed by councillors next week calling on the province to give local governments the authority to levy a surtax on vacant residential properties “to discourage vacant and derelict buildings, and encourage the occupancy, maintenance and improvement of buildings to address housing affordability and public safety.”

Isitt also proposes forwarding the motion to the Association of Vancouver Island and Coastal Communities and to the Union of B.C. Municipalities.

Isitt spoke to the idea on Thursday, noting that such a tax “would be another cost signal to send to land owners that could prevent homes from sitting vacant.”

Isitt’s comments came as Coun. Geoff Young cautioned that council should be careful with the application of tenant-relocation assistance policies so as to not unintentionally create vacant units. The policy provides guidelines on assistance to be provided to tenants when they are required to move because a building is being redeveloped.

Young cited the case of a tenant who had moved into a building on a month-to-month tenancy agreement, well after a redevelopment process for the building had begun.

“I just think we need to be aware that by imposing tenancy relocation policies in every instance, we are creating empty units that would otherwise be rented out,” Young said, noting that rather than dealing with the expense and requirements of relocating tenants, a landlord contemplating redevelopment might just choose to leave the building empty.

“The landlord, given this kind of policy, is going to be afraid to rent those units,” Young said.

“This is something that can be overdone, and I really think we have to exercise some common sense in having a more fine-grained tenancy-relocation policy in order to avoid having usable units wasted, sitting empty in contemplation of redevelopment.”

Isitt two years ago won council support for a motion that went to both the Association of Vancouver Island and Coastal Communities and the Union of B.C. Municipalities calling on the province to give all municipalities the authority to impose an empty-homes tax.

Vancouver implemented the precedent-setting tax in 2016 as part of a suite of policies designed to increase vacancy rates in the city.

The first of its kind in North America, the Vancouver empty-homes tax, levies a fee of one per cent of the assessed value for homes that are left vacant more than six months. It has been a financial windfall, bringing in $38 million in revenue in its first year. Revenues are to go to affordable-housing initiatives.

When it was implemented, it was thought more than 10,000 Vancouver properties — mostly condos — were sitting vacant instead of being rented or lived in by owners.

But city figures say the $38 million generated came from 2,538 vacant homes. The Vancouver tax does not apply to principal residences or homes rented on a long-term basis for at least six months.","Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , Evict, Evicted, Eviction, Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, Victoria Women's Transition House",1,True,0.0

I had a heat pump scheduled for install today, to replace an oil furnace. Despite me confirming and asking for clarification numerous times from the ""sales"" person, the heat pump was supposed to work in conjunction with our central forced air wood furnace. If you've never experienced a forced air wood furnace, it's something else for Vanocuver island winters, the driest and warmest heat you can imagine.

Today one of the techs who seemed very experienced, mentioned the efficiency would less, we could accept that. However another tech after talking to the manufacture said due to the static drop in the wood furnace heat exchanger and the heat from the wood furnace the warranty wouldn't be provided.

&#x200B;

After talking to them for a little while, he did mention heat pumps do dehumidify a bit even on the heat cycle. However I'm still concerned about how it'll work when the humidity is in the 90s and it's 5c out. As well our summers are extremely dry so I'm worried about over drying in the summer. My understanding is the drying is a byproduct of the cooling cycle making them ideal for hot and humid climates, I don't understand how it dehumidifies  on the heat cycle.

I just graduated from College with a degree in Engineering (B.ENG with honors) and I have to complete one last co-op until December before I can earn my degree and start working full-time. My line of work revolves around Electronics and computer engineering. 

I come from a well-educated and upper-middle class family and I am currently living with my folks because of the pandemic in ON. However, I have been waiting for the day that I can graduate and move on, and initially I wanted to get a place to rent for 4 or 5 years just to climb up the career ladder and save money before pulling the trigger on buying a home. However, my family, who owns a home in ON, told me that paying rent is essentially wasting money - which I agree with - but seeing home prices in ON is really disappointing. I have an app called Zolo where you can browse through home listings and say how much you make and how much you can downpay, and it will give you a score of how much you can afford a home. My score is consistently low by guesstimating how much I could make as an entry level engineer in the GTA area. I estimate that as an entry level, I could be making 60,000 and that is my conservative estimate. For comparison, I will be making less than 50,000 in my co-op. 

I'm young, and I want to be able to have fun so I naturally started looking for housing that are within 1 hour of the city of Toronto so that fun things are accessible. 

So then I decided to screw renting, let's buy a home that I am *contempt* with and something *affordable* for 10-15 years, then hopefully it has *increased* in price by then, and I have moved up in my career to be making more money and have a bigger savings, so then I can sell it and with my savings go invest in a bigger and better house - this time for life. Houses are very pricey, but condos and townhouses are popping up everywhere.

Things are too early to say about the company I am working for now as a co-op - if at the end, they give me a full-time position with a good starting salary, I may have to move to a completely different city and things will completely change for me (the nature of my work is mostly on-site, but because of the situation in ON, it's still WFH).  Let's just assume that after this co-op, I am a free agent.

Now on the other side of the same coin....I am looking for full time work because my co-op advisor says it's wise to do so. In my search, I have found a few positions for entry level work in my area of work in Calgary and a few in BC. Just for fun, I went on that Zolo app and was pleasantly surprised at the housing prices in Calgary 🤯! So much so that in the last 2 days, I have just been surveying houses in Calgary and saving some for when I really want to get into it. It's maddening how affordable they are as compared to housing in ON. Obviously, BC is still very expensive but the idea that they have companies that are hiring in that field makes a very enticing idea to move to either place. 

I base it on the salary of an average entry-level electrical and electronics engineer in different cities across AB, BC and ON:

2. Do you think it's wise to go for a house with bedrooms or do you think that a studio is better for me? 

3. Is it wise for a young person like me to move to AB or BC in this stage of my career or is it safer to stay in ON if the above are my intentions ? 

4. Would it be wise to move to AB or BC in my line of work ?

They had told her they were looking for a million dollar home. Buziak was apprehensive about going to the viewing because of the odd way someone with her low profile had been contacted directly for such a large deal. However she went despite her misgivings after being reassured. The sophisticated and pre-planned setting up of her homicide is believed to indicate she was personally targeted by experienced criminals with inside information. The main theories as to motive are she was believed to be a potential informant after seeing something she was not intended to, or there was some personal reason.

I was told by one daycare facility today that parents are waiting over 2 years for spaces. I was told by several daycare facilities in the last several months that I'm still on the waitlist, and the ones I was applying to as a new parent wouldn't have space for my 18 month old til she is 30 months, and their 2022 list is full. 

And then to build these facilities in places where care is needed. With the Westshore booming with new developments (both in residential and commercial properties), we need childcare spaces to go with it.  I have written my MLA (Mitzi Dean) about this, who is also the Minister of Families and Children. 

I hate that this is almost 2022 and child care is still such a mess. 

Putting my daughter in any care other than a daycare facility with ECEs ir similar structure is not an option for her at this time. And even then, it is over half our monthly rent. It's insane. The ""cheapest"" place I was quoted was about $900 with the most expensive being $2100. 

And then, the rate of pay for ECEs and those with IT certifications is just laughable and barely a living wage. So it's almost no wonder that there's next to no options for parents because why should someone work for less than a living wage? Where are all the government promises here??

Why is daycare just so effing terrible? 

1. I have been on waitlists since fall 2019. I've been told that with one particular daycare  I've moved to 3rd in line from about 60 applicants in 2019. I'm still waiting.

2. I joined more waitlists when my daughter was born that I couldn't join when I was pregnant. Still waiting.

3. There are zero spots til kids are 2.5 years anywhere unless you have a ton of money. Even with subsidy, the prices are around $1,270  monthly for her and her needs... and she's not special needs or on the spectrum. She's just a kid that likes being busy and playing in puddles.

4. The $10 a day child care means sweet eff all if there are no spots in the first place. 

5. Home care/nanny/""just a mom looking to take on another kid"" isn't an option for us as we do not want that for our daughter for personal reasons. 

6. It is 2021 and my coparent and I were forced to make the choice to see which one of us wasn't going back to work so our daughter could be looked after. It is no one else's responsibility to raise our child but our own, and that's one of the reasons we want a daycare/learning environment. But when you can't afford child care, and you have no family in the province, what option do you have?  We are doing our best, but know she would just thrive in a setting with other kids.

Her father is now the stay at home parent and I'm the bread winner. We are now a single income family living in one of the most expensive cities in Canada. This is not the way it is supposed to be.

I'm so sad for  parents who have to choose between career and a family.  How did it get so bad?","Our Place, Social structure ",1,False,54.54545454545454

VictoriaBC,worldsmostmediummom,"Publication Bans on Sexual Assault Survivors When Sammie shared her story on publication bans last month, there was interest in getting a petition signed. I shared my case here in June 2021 and was just in Ottawa last month fighting for change at a Justice Committee meeting. Things are finally moving. Here's where we are at.

I am hoping I can count on your support with the below petition. This is directly related to the work I was doing in Ottawa last month supporting a survivor’s right to say their name without legal consequences.

https://petitions.ourcommons.ca/en/Petition/Sign/e-4192


This is an official petition with the Government of Canada and supported by MP Laurel Collins (Victoria). A private members bill is also being introduced by her in the next short while supporting the same.

Please support a survivor’s right to their name and story. Please help push for change in our system and help give survivors of sexual violence a choice in the application of the ban and simplify the process to remove the ban should one choose. 

Currently, prosecutors may request a publication ban to anonymize a victim-complainant under section 486.4 of the Criminal Code of Canada. However, prosecutors do not advise, inform, nor request consent of a victim-complainant if a ban is placed on their identity. The law does not require that the court or prosecutor inform a victim-complainant, at any time before, during or after the proceedings, that a ban is in force. Most are unaware a ban is in force nor advised of legal repercussions and penalties for breaching the ban when speaking publicly or privately about their experience, resulting in up to a $5,000 fine or up to 2 years in custody.


For perspective, the person convicted of assaulting me received 18 months house arrest and paid a $100 fine. My fine for simply saying my name would have been significantly worse than that. This needs to change.

This concerns the informed choice and consent for victims. The prohibition by the Courts prevent a victim-complainant from speaking of their experience which is paternalistic, and reinforces a sense of shame and the notion that anonymity is protection, rather than support and information. Moreover, it is also in conflict with section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the freedom of expression, thought, belief, expression.


Publication bans infer that the offender/accused is protected and serves to directly benefit as the restriction and limitation prevents the victim-complainant from communicating, publicly or privately, regarding the offence and harm experienced.


Your information is NOT shared with any political party and you will NOT receive any mail other than updates on the petition if you wish.

IMPORTANT: Once you sign the petition, you will be asked to verify your email address. You need to verify your email address in order for the signature to count. Please check your spam mail if you don't see anything. It takes about 30 seconds for the email to come through.


Please share this across Canada on all your social media platforms if you are comfortable with doing so. Anyone who is a resident or citizen of Canada can sign the petition. 

If you have any questions about publication bans or need more information, I am happy to fill you in on the process.

Thank you for your support.

Edit: 

1. There is NO automatic ban. It is applied for by Crown and the judge has no discretionary power - meaning the ban is implemented immediately and the judge has to apply it.

The problem is the ban is put on our names the vast majority of the time without our knowledge or consent. We are never told there is a ban on our name, or what the ban means and where the limits are. This is not to say this happens at every single case - a very small handful of people are made aware of the ban - but it is applied for inconsistently and without much information. 

2. Publication bans are important and I'm not advocating to get rid of the bans. It should be an informed choice if someone wants a ban on their name. This is a simple amendment.","Our Place, Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, People with lived experience, Person experiencing homelessness , Social Housing , Social problem , Victoria Sexual Assault Centre, Violence",0,False,10.0
VictoriaBC,worldsmostmediummom,"Update on Publication Bans and sexual assault survivors Hi folks,

A few months ago, I posted information about how myself and a small handful of other sexual assault survivor-turned-advocates were fighting to have s.486.4 of our Criminal Code amended. I wanted to give an update for those of you who were interested in our work.

The long of the short of it: victim-complainants of sexual offences have publication bans applied to their name without their knowledge of consent. This means that they are not freely allowed to speak about what happened to them without facing $5,000 in fines or 2 years in jail. It also means that we have to go back to court to ask for permission to attach our names to our experience... and it gives the accused/offender a chance to present arguments why we should remain under a court imposed ban.

What do we want? Very simply...

1. Stop prosecuting victim-complainants if they breach the ban.

2. Simplify the process for removing the ban at any time during the court process and make sure that the opinion of the offender or accused is not a factor.

3. Request consent from the victim-complainant before applying a s486.4 ban to their name.

4. Provide clear and multi-lingual information about 486.4 publication bans on government websites

We have been busy - Holy smokes have we been busy!

Our petition closed with 4,900 electronic signatures and just over 100 paper signatures. Thank you to all who signed and shared our work! We are so grateful for your support!

Here's what we have been up to:

In late January, myself and a small group of survivors officially launched www.MyVoiceMyChoice.org - an initiative created by Canadian victim-complainants for Canadian victim-complainants to ensure that no one is forced into an unwanted publication ban after being sexually assaulted.

At the beginning of March, my case was the feature story on the Canadian True Crime podcast ( https://canadiantruecrime.ca/episodes/130) in a two part series about what can happen when publication bans backfire... essentially,   what happens when a shield turns into a sword. It touches on the impact the unknown and unwanted publication ban had on me and how it jeopardized  the safety of others in Victoria. The details are graphic - all information in the podcast are from my court transcripts and court related documents. It is undisputed fact and gives the full story about what happened to me in September 2015. There were parts of the trial I never heard, such as his full defense or how the defence painted my character. It also goes through the journey I had to remove the ban.

In mid-March, our petition closed and things really started to take off. We were finally getting responses from more politicians willing to listen to our concerns and MP Laurel Collins suggested we go to Ottawa  the first weeks of May to kick off Sexual Assault Awareness Month. 

While we are in Ottawa, we will be meeting with 7 senators to let them know we are lived experiences and political validators showing how bad this law can backfire. We want them to be prepared in case one day there is ever a Bill that hits their desk, they know what it is for and why they need to vote in favour if it.

Also while in Ottawa, we will get to watch our petition be tabled in House, as well as listen to two statements read out about us and our work. We are hosting an information reception with MPs across all parties invited to come speak with us and ask any questions about our cause. We also are hosting a town hall with cross party support.

It is going to be a very, very busy week for us.

As with most other victim-turned-advicates, we are doing this work in our spare time and our travel is self funded. If you are able to help us with getting to Ottawa so we can help get our campaign to get  s.486.4 of the Criminal Code amended, please visit www.MyVoiceMyChoice.org for more info or visit www.tinyurl.com/MVMC-GoFundMe to donate to us.There are 8 of us going from all over Canada to watch our work come to light. I can't begin to tell you how emotional this trip will be.

We have done everything asked of us after being assaulted.  We reported to police. We took part in our trials. We have been vocal advocates in our communities fighting for change and a result of how we were treated in this legal system and have several recommendations to make sure this never happens again.

In solidarity,

VictoriaBC,worldsmostmediummom,"Update: Publication Ban Laws in Sexual Offence Trials Hi everyone,

I wanted to give you folks an update on where we are with our journey to amend s486.4 publication ban laws in Canada. For those not familiar with my story, [Canadian True Crime](https://canadiantruecrime.ca/episodes/130) did a two part episode on sexual assaults and publication bans (also featuring the stories of other BC survivors going through the same thing).

**Background:**

Currently, a publication ban is an order the Court makes under s 486.4 of the Criminal Code of Canada at the request of the Crown or victim that prevents anyone from publishing, broadcasting, or transmitting any information that could identify a victim-complainant or witness who participates in the criminal justice system relating to sexual offences. Once a judge has ordered a publication ban in a criminal case, information that could identify the complainant or witnesses cannot be transmitted (for example, in an email). The publication ban is intended to allow these people to participate in the justice system without suffering the negative consequences of being publicly identified.  The ban is effective immediately and lasts indefinitely, even after the victim dies.

It is important to note that the victim must also comply with the order. However, many victims of sexual offences are not consulted by the Crown before a publication is imposed on their identity, nor are they notified afterwards. This is where the problem is.

The law does not oblige the Court or prosecutor to inform a victim-complainant that a ban has been placed on their identity, resulting in many being unaware a ban is in place or of the legal repercussions and penalties for breaching it. The law currently says the Court should try to let the victim know at the first reasonable opportunity that there is a ban in place, but there is nothing that firmly says a victim-complainant must be notified.   Every person who fails to comply with a s.486.4 publication ban order is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction. This means that they can face a fine up to $5,000 and/or a term of imprisonment of up to two years less a day.  This includes the victim themselves.

The ban is on the victim's name only, but it can result in the accused’s being shielded as well – especially if victims cannot talk freely about what happened to them. Publication bans were designed for the sole benefit of the victim-complainant or witness and not to provide protection to the accused/offender.

A publication ban stays in place after the criminal proceedings are over even in no findings of guilt, or charges are withdrawn, or a plea deal is reached. If the accused pleads guilty to something other than the original criminal charge, for example, uttering threats, the publication ban still remains in place. The publication ban stays in place even if the verdict is appealed.  The stats on sexual assault are pathetically low, and we all know that ""not guilty"" does not always mean ""innocent"". There is no way for us to warn people there is a predator in the area when we have these bans on our name.

When an application to remove the ban on the victim's name is entered into the Courts, the accused or convicted will receive notice of the application and be given the opportunity in court to present their reasons why the victim should not be able to tell their story or freely say their name without consequences. At this point, we are essentially asking permission from the courts and our abusers to allow us to speak freely.

**Update**

 https://www.timescolonist.com/top-stories/no-longer-silent-more-victims-of-sexual-violence-fight-publication-bans-imposed-in-their-names-7097650  

Last month, a few of us from [My Voice, My Choice](https://www.myvoicemychoice.org) were in Ottawa speaking to parliamentarians about [Bill S-12](https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/s-12), which aims to change the way s486.4 is applied on victim-complainants of sexual offenses.  We had around 16 meetings/events/gatherings in total over 4 1/2 days - we were exhausted by the time we got back home, but we feel very heard.

While the Bill is a good start, we have several amendments to it:

1. Amend Criminal Code section 486.4 so it is not a criminal offence for a victim-complainant to share their experience.
2. Simplify the process to remove a publication ban making it clear that the opinion of the offender or accused are not a factor.
3. Ensure prosecutors explain the purpose of a publication ban and seek consent from the victim-complainant prior to requesting one.
4. Ensure and educate prosecutors and judges to make sure they are trauma informed on a victim-complainant’s right to choose if they want a publication ban or not.

The next step for us happens on Thursday June 8th at 9:30am PST where Morrell Andrews (the one leading the charge) will speak to the Senate about the above noted amendments to the Bill. It is likely our last shot at getting this right before it goes to a final reading and a vote.

We are all for publication bans and recognize their importance - we just want someone to ask us if we want one on our names to begin with, and to simplify the process to remove the ban at any time before, during, or after the trial.

Dan McLaughlin, who said that most of us welcome the ban, has never spoken to a survivor of sexual violence and it shows. Of the dozens of women I have worked with, only one has said she wanted the ban (because her trial was high profile). Dan's comments are dismissive and harmful. He does not speak for us. None of us were ever consulted for him to have that opinion,  and we are arguably the loudest people in the province on the topic.

[12]       The purpose of a section 486.4 publication ban is to encourage the reporting of sexual offences by protecting the privacy and identity of the alleged victim. However, in my respectful view, when a victim of a sexual assault comes before the court, as Ms. Favro has, and asks to have a publication ban lifted so that they can openly discuss and publish the details of the offence, including identifying themselves as the victim, the request ought to be respected and granted unless there is a strong and articulable reason why the ban should remain in place. In the present case, I can find none. To be more specific, I see no reason why Ms. Favro should be prohibited from publishing the fact that she was the victim who Mr. Erickson sexually assaulted.","Our Place, Victoria Sexual Assault Centre, Violence",0,False,0.0
VictoriaBC,wormofautumn,"For those seeking dental treatment in Vic I’ve noticed quite a few posts over the last month both here and the Vancouver subreddit of people trying to find out which dental offices are still open for providing treatment. Our regulatory body (The College of Dental Surgeons of British Columbia) doesn’t seem to be doing a great job of keeping the public informed in regards to dental care during the pandemic situation we’re in. They did however issue very straightforward recommendations to us as health care providers and have advised all clinics to only perform treatment when absolutely necessary. All elective procedures should absolutely wait. I’ve copied and pasted their guidelines as to what that does and doesn’t entail down below. If you’re wondering if your dental issue falls into the category of needing to be addressed now rather than waiting, you can refer to it for some idea:

EMERGENT CARE
 
Emergency dental care is defined as potentially life-threatening conditions requiring immediate management or treatment to stop ongoing tissue bleeding, alleviate severe pain or infection and include:
-Cellulitis as a result of an uncontrolled infection compromising the airway
-Severe uncontrolled hemorrhage (bleeding)
-Trauma to the orofacial complex especially to facial bones that potentially compromise the patient’s airway
-Uncontrolled severe pain
-Uncontrolled infection
 

ESSENTIAL (URGENT) CARE 
 
Essential care is separate from emergency care and focuses on the management and treatment of conditions that require immediate attention to relieve pain and/or risk of infection. These should be treated as minimally invasively as possible. These conditions would include (but not limited to):
-Pericoronitis or third molar pain
-Post-operative osteitis (dry socket dressing changes)
-Abscess with localized pain and swelling
-Treatment required before critical medical procedures can be provided
-Dental trauma involving avulsion or luxation of a tooth
-Tooth fracture resulting in pain or causing soft tissue trauma
 

NON-ESSENTIAL (ELECTIVE) CARE
Non-essential care is routine or non-urgent procedures and would include (but not limited to):
-Recall examinations including routine radiographs
-Routine debridement and preventive therapies
-Orthodontic procedures other than those to address acute issues (e.g. pain, infection, trauma)
-Restorative dentistry (including treatment of asymptomatic carious lesions)
-Aesthetic dental procedures.",Complex care ,1,False,66.66666666666666

I recently had to move out of my parking spot in my building (renting the spot, the owner needed it) and am now looking for a parking spot desperately. However, I remember when I searched years ago there were numerous ads online about parking in and around downtown Victoria. 

Now it seems usedvictoria, kijiji, and craigslist are fairly empty of anything. Are there any other resources to post ads or browse for anyone renting?

Is anyone renting a parking spot at or near 845 Yates (Yates and Quadra?) Definitely paying well!

BC United is saying they want to add a bunch of exemptions, like allowing people to use their ""vacation homes"" as Airbnb's. These exemptions will make the system harder and more expensive to regulate and will ultimately reduce the number of units brought back to the long term market.

You gotta love Eby's response though:

>B.C. Premier David Eby accused the opposition of opposing the planned  crackdown and seeking to add “a whole bunch of exemptions in for  investors.”  
>  
>He said housing in the province’s major cities  needs to be available for people who live and work in the province,  providing services ranging from retail to health care.

VictoriaBC,yyj_paddler,"Housing Affordability: Victoria NIMBY's are trying to stop the Missing Middle Initiative I attended yesterday's [Missing Middle Initiative](https://engage.victoria.ca/missing-middle-housing/) (MMI) information session. There were a number of angry NIMBY's in the chat being pretty condescending and negative about the initiative. Today I started seeing negative letters in the Times Colonist. They are looking for any way they can to stop or cripple the initiative. Despite having over two years to participate, they are claiming this is being rushed through and they are claiming it's not what most people want.

If you care about the initiative, or more generally, about the housing crisis in Victoria, you need to keep showing your support. If you do, we have a really good chance of making some actual progress towards reasonable housing choices in this city. This initiative has been very popular and well supported so far, let's not let up before we cross the finish line. The NIMBY's are counting on most of us to be complacent so that they can keep the status quo.

# How can you support it?

~~Assuming the initiative passes city council's two readings~~, it is scheduled for public hearing on August 4, 2022. This is where you could make a difference. [You can write a letter, send a pre-recorded message or you can call in during the hearing.](https://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/news-events/public-notices/public-hearings.html) It really does make a difference!

# Background

For those who don't know, the Missing Middle Initiative is trying to make it easier to provide more types of housing in the city. Currently, we are very limited by single family zoning practices which cover most of the land in the entire region. This makes it incredibly difficult and costly to provide anything other than single-family housing. It's either that, or skyscrapers in the few places that you can build anything else. The MMI aims to bridge that gap slightly by allowing some gentle density increases, like townhouses, duplexes, fourplexes etc... Just like the name says, it provides something in between: AKA the ""missing middle""

VictoriaBC,yyj_paddler,"Last Night Saanich Council Voted 8:1 in Favor of 95 Units of Housing on Shelbourne Last night, Saanich council voted 8:1 in favor of a new 95 unit housing project on Shelbourne. Councillor Nathalie Chambers was the only vote against, no surprise.

**Background:**

This was the project that was in the news and on this subreddit back in February. The project is compliant with Saanich’s OCP so staff recommended approving it but unfortunately Saanich council decided to hold a (optional) public hearing instead. Now, four months of additional delay later, we got to hear all the usual complaints and support that we hear at every hearing (I watched the recording early this morning).

**Highlights:**

* **Students showing up big for housing!** Last night there were some fantastic speeches given by students. This is not insignificant. Last night’s hearing had like 20-30 people come to talk and it was split down the middle between opposition and support. The students who came to share their perspective and experience had a big impact along with other folks who are taking their time to support housing (unfortunately I couldn’t make it because I was busy with other things so I’m glad some other people could take time out of their night to support this housing that I need but couldn’t be present to have my voice heard)
* Karen Harper is a gem. She really understands our climate and housing crises and she made some great points in her speech last night. For example:
   * On environment: *“The single most effective thing we can do is infill housing to reduce reliance on cars. It's more than anything else that we can do.”*
   * On affordability and height: *“There's also been the question of affordability … the reality is, as we reduce height, we increase the cost of the remaining units so the degree to which we want to even make things attainable, it is important to keep that in mind.”*
* Teale Phelps Bondaroff made some good points about sustainability and affordability in his speeches:
   * *“I also wanted to reiterate the importance of dense walkable communities that are built along these corridors. These are the types of communities that we're building are more affordable and they're better for the environment.”*
   * *“if you look at stats Canada, the average family spending 12 thousand dollars a year in transportation. That doesn't come from bikes my bike costs like 400 bucks to reason to do a tuneup that comes from private automobiles. So transportation is linked to affordabilities so i see that being connected to projects. That's one of the reasons why i love putting density on our corridors and this is one of our corridor Shelbourne is a major corridor”*
   * *“I reject the argument that protecting trees is the only form of environmentalism Um, folks who know me will know that I do a lot of work and conservation and it does pain me to see some trees go down, especially this kind of number of trees. But we need housing and we need housing on our core corridors and one of the things I wrote down here was* ***if we can't put density along, our major corridors, where can we put it?*** *And the answer is nowhere that's going to, you know, impact our environment less.”*
* Colin Plant redeemed himself somewhat to me last night in his speech:
   * *“Our policies in Saanich are not based on next door neighbors. Our policies are based on the greater good of Saanich.”*
   * *“We also need to consider the people who will have work. And that we do have people as much as there is a lot of aspersion cast on developers. Um and unless they're actually the owners of the company they are also employees of somebody. And so I have some appreciation that it's not just some Unknown person at the top of a pyramid. There are people who will build these units who may live in Saanich. There are people who will provide the furniture. They will provide the appliances. So, I am not going to Um, Discount that aspect of it. It's not just ‘is this affordable? No, don't approve it.’ There is so much more to this decision.”*

Anyway, just wanted to share this with those of you who also could not make it or were not aware of this. In hearings where we are only seeing 10's of people it really makes a difference when some people can make it to let council know they want this housing.  It's guaranteed that the angriest 10-20 people who don't the housing will show up to speak against it.

It's pretty crazy that in Saanich it's controversial to build dense housing even on an arterial along a major transportation corridor that is close by the Hillside mall. I really think Bondaroff hit the nail on the head when he said ""if we can't put density along our major corridors, where can we put it?""","Affordable, Affordable Housing, Affordable housing , Lived Experience, Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, People with lived experience, Point in Time",1,True,36.36363636363637
VictoriaBC,yyj_paddler,"Last night Victoria Council approved a development that will provide ~540 homes, daycare space, a full grocery store and more! Exciting Victoria housing news! 

Last night Victoria had a Special Council meeting where they held two public hearings for what I think is a really cool housing project. The project consists of two sites and two rezoning applications:

* The first hearing was for a mixed-use development consisting of 3 towers on a podium that has commercial space, located at 710 Caledonia Avenue and 1961 Douglas Street.
* The second hearing was for a new supportive housing building that will replace the old hotel that got turned into supportive housing. It is located at 722 and 726 Discovery Street.

The **first project was approved unanimously** (except Stephen Hammond and Krista Loughton were not present).

The second project (supportive housing) was approved with only Marg Gardiner voting against it.

The breakdown of housing types is roughly:

* 133 units of below market, purpose-built rental housing run by BC Housing
* 90 units of supportive housing run by BC Housing
* 171 units of market purpose-built rental housing
* 148 units of market condos

And some highlights of the project:

* 30 accessible units that meet National Standards of Canada “barrier-free” design guidelines
* A park/plaza area open to the public
* A full size grocery store in an area that currently lacks grocery stores
* A new mid-block crosswalk on Discovery Street
* A new raised, separated bike lane
* A new bus stop
* **At least 127** **two-bedroom** units
* **At least 37** **three-bedroom** units
* A daycare center
* The supportive housing is being constructed on what is currently surface parking. This will allow the current tenants of the hotel to stay there until the new building is done, meaning **they won’t be displaced**. Once that is done, the hotel will be demolished and the land used for the 3 tower podium building.

This is probably one of the most ideal projects the city has seen. It provides housing across the spectrum of housing needs and it brings much needed amenities to an area of the downtown that is currently under served. Several residents called in to express strong support and excitement about the new grocery store, saying that they currently don't live near one that they can walk to.

VictoriaBC,yyj_paddler,"NIMBY voices are amplified at our council meetings and it favors certain voices over others I was reading [this article from 10 months ago, where Colwood council unanimously rejected a 142-unit apartment building.](https://www.thewestshore.ca/p/colwood-council-rejects-142-unit-apartment-proposal) and it’s been bugging me, so I decided to write a giant wall of text and share that with all of you.


Specifically what stood out to me in this article was what one of Colwood’s councilors, Cynthia Day, said about the decision to reject the apartment:


> “I would love to support a project like this that has less blasting and more land preserved, but I’m in a hard spot **because this plan is not sitting well with our community. It’s not my job to convince the public to accept this plan, that’s your job,”** Coun. Cynthia Day said.


If Colwood council was basing their decision on who showed up to their public hearing, then they were very likely biased to favor NIMBY viewpoints over those of the general public. 


How many people in Colwood do you think Cynthia heard from? How many of you reading this show up to public hearings? The problem is it’s mostly people who don't like developments near them who show up to hearings, and **every** infill development has at least some people who don't like it. So it’s problematic when councilors see the feedback from those people as representing the general public.


The Canada-British Columbia Expert Panel on the Future of Housing Supply and Affordability report ""[Opening doors: unlocking housing supply for affordability](https://engage.gov.bc.ca/app/uploads/sites/121/2021/06/Opening-Doors_BC-Expert-Panel_Final-Report_Jun16.pdf)"" (published in 2021 in response to our housing crisis) identified this as a problem, saying: 


> “An important aspect of governance is the land-use planning process, which offers citizens opportunities to provide input on new development based on both real and perceived impacts. We believe that democratic processes are important, but that **overreliance on public hearings to make land-use decisions tends to favor certain voices over others.** This can result in perceptions of majority opposition to new development, **especially when the citizens most motivated and available to participate in the process generally oppose the development plans.**”


> “This opposition puts political pressure on the elected officials in charge of reviewing the proposals. **Its influence strengthens further as those who support or stand to benefit from new housing supply often do not attend public hearings to voice their views and priorities.** Such proceedings contribute to a land-use planning system that prevents new housing supply in two ways: first, by restricting or impeding growth as a consequence of lengthy, uncertain and costly processes; and second, by **allowing anti-development interests to apply disproportionate political pressure on decision makers.**”


The report also said, in the section titled “NIMBYism”, that:


> … there are invariably vocal groups of residents—particularly neighbourhood associations—that can make it politically difficult for local governments to implement such changes. It is important to note that opponents to development, including but not limited to neighbourhood associations, may not be representative of the broader population. For instance, research has found that in Vancouver and Toronto, members of neighbour associations are more likely to be white, older, more educated, homeowners, who have lived in their homes for longer and hold different policy priorities than the general population. **To make inroads toward fairer, more representative discussions on land use and the way our neighbourhoods evolve, it is therefore important to make sure that all voices and interests are able to shape how our cities grow.**


Councilors are supposed to lead, not just do whatever a small group of people who happen to show up to a particular hearing tell them to do. So, yes, **it is your job to convince the public and to LEAD,** Cynthia!


This is just one example of what’s happening in basically every city. 

I also remember not too long ago [Saanich council voted to send an apartment building to an (optional) public hearing ](https://www.timescolonist.com/local-news/six-storey-shelbourne-condo-complex-goes-to-public-hearing-after-neighbours-call-for-more-discussion-6634908). At that meeting, “council was swayed Monday night by the concerns of neighbours, who said the building proposed by Abstract Developments would be too large and out of character for the neighbourhood.” Saanich councilor Colin Plant justified his vote saying (in response to the NIMBY pressure at the meeting) “it’s very clear tonight, **the public has an interest** in having a public hearing.”

That seems like a pretty biased view of what the “public interest” is right now and it seems pretty out of touch with the housing crisis we are facing.

In light of the recent housing announcements I felt it was a good time to bring this issue up.

VictoriaBC,yyj_paddler,"Some information about Victoria's recent ban of overnight sheltering at all times in four parks Yesterday there was a lot of discussion about this [in another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/17m5ofd/victoria_council_considers_camping_ban_in_four/?rdt=63431). Since then, I spent some time to watch the [Committee of the Whole Meeting](https://pub-victoria.escribemeetings.com/Meeting.aspx?Id=35d3da5e-c124-401b-9f98-9e39cabdcd61&Agenda=Merged&lang=English) where council voted to pass the bylaw to prohibit overnight sheltering in those parks.

First of all, the bylaw passed, meaning that **overnight sheltering will no longer be allowed, at any time, in the following parks**:

* Stadacona
* Topaz
* Hollywood
* Regatta Point

Previously, sheltering would have been allowed between 7PM and 7AM. My understanding is that this will officially come into effect on November 9th.

This bylaw is the result of council deciding in June to hire a Parks Relocation Coordinator for the purpose of ""overseeing the transition out of sheltering from the named parks to areas not within City parks or on boulevards.""

There were 16 named individuals across the 4 parks who were offered housing. After the Parks Relocation Coordinator worked with them to get housing, **only 2 shelters remained**. Presumably, those are from those who declined the offer of housing..

ALSO, I learned that for the staff count of all the parks, for the week of October 22 to October 28, **staff counted 35 structures** across 12 parks\*\*.\*\* So that is a rough ballpark for how many total there are in Victoria right now. Note that this isn't individuals, it's structures, so there are probably more than 35 people that are living in parks across Victoria.

Furthermore, council has asked staff for a report that will provide information about all the other parks so they can make informed decisions about which ones to tackle next. According to staff, this report is expected to be ready in about 3 weeks. It appears that council's plan is to continue following this approach for our other parks, incrementally approaching campers and connecting them with housing and then prohibiting sheltering in those parks. For those who want to see other parks cleaned up, I think this is hopeful!

&#x200B;

I highly suggest watching Krista Loughton's closing statement. She gave an emotional speech where I learned that this program was her idea. You can [watch that here](https://pub-victoria.escribemeetings.com/Players/ISIStandAlonePlayer.aspx?Id=35d3da5e-c124-401b-9f98-9e39cabdcd61), timestamp 4:34:38. For those who don't know, Krista is someone who has worked a lot with homeless people and even [produced a documentary](https://www.homelesshub.ca/resource/us-them-eye-opening-documentary-homelessness) about that.

&#x200B;

Overall I think this is really good progress and a win-win that everyone in Victoria should be celebrating. For those who want to see our parks get cleaned up and our homeless housed instead of pushed from one place to another, this is a win! Like they're actually making some friggin progress.

If you're someone who wants to see a compassionate approach that gets homeless people housed, this is a win.

If you're someone who wants to see an end to sheltering in parks, this is a win.

The fact that this is a win-win is evident by how well supported this was by most of the councilors. For example, Chris Coleman, a councilor who many of our conservative, tough on crime type folks likely support, seems to believe in this program and the approach of incrementally tackling the parks in this way. [You can watch his closing comments at 4:43:20](https://pub-victoria.escribemeetings.com/Players/ISIStandAlonePlayer.aspx?Id=35d3da5e-c124-401b-9f98-9e39cabdcd61).

The only councilor who wasn't supportive was Marg Gardiner and the reason was that she is salty that her parks didn't get chosen instead of these ones. I think Coleman addressed this well. He said that he's the representative for Oaklands which has a park that wasn't on the list and he hears a lot of concern from residents about their parks, but he understands that this will take time, that this is just one step in the process, it's not the end state. He seems to believe in this.

&#x200B;

I really think that this is a win for Victoria and it feels quite hopeful. Based on that staff report, the amount of sheltering in our parks (35 structures) isn't as high as you'd think given all the rheotric on reddit. The city has a strategy for actually getting people out of parks and then restricting any further sheltering that complies with the legal obligations imposed by the province, and it's working! I expect future parks to follow.

Whichever ""side"" you fall on I don't see how this isn't positive news and I'm saddened that nobody seems to have really caught on to this :(","Aboriginal Coalition to End Homelessness, BC Housing, Camper, Community Plan to End Homelessness , Crime , Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness , Homeless, Homelessness , Our Place, Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program, Peers Victoria Resources Society , People with lived experience, Point in Time, Shelter, Sooke Transition House Society, Victoria Women's Transition House, WiN",1,True,0.0

VictoriaBC,yyj_paddler,"Victoria just beefed up its ""missing middle"" policy today! Hey all! Some good news on the housing front. Just today, city council reviewed the [staff report](https://pub-victoria.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=93037) and recommendations to “fix” the Missing Middle Housing Initiative, which was triggered by the scheduled six month review. That review found that the policy was too restrictive and resulted in next to no new housing qualifying under the missing middle bylaw.

Staff recommended a number of improvements and suggestions which council supported. But wait, there’s more!

Jeremy Caradonna proposed several amendments which were roughly:

- Delegate parking variances for missing middle houses to staff (goal is to allow car-light/free missing middle housing)

- Reduce front yard setbacks for plexes from 6.1m to 4.0m (goal is to make it possible to build missing middle housing on more sizes of lots and to prioritize backyard/shared spaces that are useful over lawns in the front that nobody uses)

- Increase the maximum height allowed and require that the basement suites have a finished ceiling that is at least 1.1m above average grade (goal is to ensure basement suites are livable)

And Marianne Alto proposed an additional amendment

- Increase the maximum allowable site coverage of corner townhomes to 50%.

Mayor Marianne Alto and councilors Jeremy Caradonna, Susan Kim, Matt Dell, Krista Loughton, Dave Thompson, and Chris Coleman supported all amendments.

Councilors Stephen Hammond and Marg Gardiner made a lot of NIMBY statements and voted against several of the amendments. No surprises there!

All in all, very positive changes. Will it be enough to see some missing middle houses get built? We’ll have to wait and see. There will be another review at the 18 month mark, so about a year from now. If I had to get out my crystal ball, I would predict that these changes are substantial enough to allow at least some houses and we won't get another report that says essentially none qualified. But that’s just my gut feeling, I really don’t know. And to be clear, this policy is NOT intended to be the solution to the housing crisis. It’s just one of many things the city can do to make things better.

Big props to Caradonna for leading the charge on those amendments and kudos to all the other councilors who supported them 👏","Peer Housing Support, Peer Housing Support Program",1,True,0.0

Posted with FLEC and ROAM (on Facebook and usedvictoria),

Set out items of my clothes with my scent,
Set out a mat she lays on frequently, 
Checked for an hour around the neighbour almost every two hours, and
put up posters close to home.
