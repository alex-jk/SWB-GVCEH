Marty Steen for deceit and neglect of duty.\nDeputy Chief Steve Ing heard rumours in April 2018 that Steen attended only the first day of the conference, held in February of that year.\n\nWhen asked about it, Steen told his supervisor he went to all but two presentations. He later told the supervisor that he attended only one training session on the conference\u2019s final day.\n\nHe also submitted expense claims for lunch on two days, despite lunch being provided by the conference.\nSteen was investigated under the Police Act.\n\nOn March 7, 2019, Deputy Chief Colin Watson, acting as the discipline authority, found that Steen had neglected his duty by failing to attend the training conference. Watson proposed that Steen receive a verbal reprimand as discipline for this misconduct, said the OPCC notice of review.\n\nWatson also found Steen committed deceit by making misleading statements about his attendance to his supervisors on March 29, 2018, and April 11, 2018. The discipline for this was revocation of Steen\u2019s pending promotion.\n\nAt the time the matter arose, Steen had been on a list for promotion to sergeant. Victoria Police Chief Del Manak decided to delay the promotion pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nAt the discipline proceeding, Steen told Watson that deceit by a police officer is always serious, but said the circumstances in his case were less serious than those that affect the public or the administration of justice. He told Watson there was \u201czero chance of future misconduct,\u201d that this was a lapse in judgment and completely out of character.\n\nWatson was concerned that Steen did not seem to be taking full responsibility for his conduct.\n\nThe deputy chief said he believed that a reasonable person would be troubled to learn that an officer, in these circumstances, would be promoted to a position of increased authority, influence and responsibility.\nHe was also \u201cconcerned there would be a high degree of general concern among police officers within the department with a promotion at this time.\u201d\n\nOn March 12, 2019, Steen asked for what is called a review on the record.\nOfficers are entitled to a review when disciplined with a dismissal or reduction in rank.\n\nPecknold found that the proposed discipline did not amount to an actual reduction in rank, and ordered that it be reviewed.\n\n\u201cEven though Constable Steen was set to be promoted to the rank of sergeant, he was not promoted due to the Chief Constable exercising his discretion to not promote Constable Steen,\u201d said the OPCC notice of review.\n\n\u201cConstable Steen remained a first class constable throughout the investigative and disciplinary process. Referring to this disciplinary measure as \u2018a reduction in rank\u2019 is not correct.\u201d\n\nIn ordering the review, Pecknold also cited the seriousness of the complaint and the fact that the case could undermine public confidence in police.\nRon McKinnon, a retired B.C.

I have not seen much discussion about this so am guessing most residents have no idea it's occurring.\n\nI attended a community association meeting earlier this month where it became known that the city is wanting to push through community boundary changes with arguably minimal meaningful consultation and 2 month deadline.\n\nThe crux of the city's argument appears to be that the current community boundaries do not match their \"villages and corridors\" plan.  Instead of designing their plan around what exists on the ground they want to redo the community boundaries to match sim city style.\n\nA map was shown at the meeting but so far I have not been able to find any public version of it.
